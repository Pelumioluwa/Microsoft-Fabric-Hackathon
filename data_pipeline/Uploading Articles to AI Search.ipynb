Provincial Nominee Class as described in section 87 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) and, in accordance with subsection 8(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), to establish provisions concerning the selection of and acquisition of immigration status by foreign nationals nominated by New Brunswick. 1.2 In the event of a conflict between this Annex and the IRPA, the IRPR, or Ministerial Instructions given under the IRPA, Canada and New Brunswick agree that the IRPA, the IRPR, or Ministerial instructions shall prevail. 1.3 The objectives of this Annex are: 1.3.1 To strengthen New Brunswick’s ability to enhance the economic benefits of immigration to the province taking into account New Brunswick’s economic priorities as well as the development of Francophone Minority Communities in the province; 1.3.2 To continue to support the increase of the number of French-Speaking Immigrants to New Brunswick; 1.3.3 To recognize that the Provincial Nominee Class, as established by subsection 87(1) of the IRPR and this Annex, provide for the establishment of a jointly administered immigration program, where: New Brunswick is responsible for: the recruitment, assessment and nomination of Provincial Nominees on the basis of their ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick; the promotion of New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program; the integrity of the New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program; and ensuring that effective performance monitoring and evaluation systems, consistent with the national Provincial Nominee Program Performance Measurement and ","3":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees0"},{"0":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees","1":"1","2":"Evaluation Frameworks, are in place in New Brunswick. Canada is responsible for: ensuring that applicants admitted under the Provincial Nominee Program have met the requirements of membership in the economic class as provided under the IRPA, and that they are assessed for nomination using criteria designed to determine their eligibility for consideration in the economic class; making the final selection and admissibility decisions and issuing visas; and ensuring that performance monitoring and evaluation systems are in place at the federal level to ensure that the national Provincial Nominee Program continues to meet its economic objectives. 1.3.4 To process New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominees for permanent residence as expeditiously as possible, taking into account: New Brunswick’s annual Provincial Nominee Program plan; Canada’s projected annual immigration levels plan as per section 94 of the IRPA; the number of provincial nomination certificates issued in each calendar year, as referred to in section 3.4; legislative and regulatory requirements, including eligibility, admissibility and Ministerial Instructions; and operational and resource constraints. 2.0 Shared Principles 2.1 Canada and New Brunswick agree to abide by and uphold the following shared principles: 2.1.1 New Brunswick is best positioned to: determine the specific economic and labour market needs of New Brunswick vis-à-vis immigration; and assess and nominate candidates that will meet these economic and labour market needs and have the ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick. 2.1.2 Canada is responsible for national immigration policy direction, the overall design and management of the movement of Permanent and Temporary Residents to Canada and, in accordance with section 94 of the IRPA, for the establishment of an annual immigration plan containing a projection of the number of immigrants to be admitted to Canada each year in total and in each immigrant ","3":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees1"},{"0":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees","1":"2","2":"category; and, in accordance with section 87.3 of the IRPA, for the processing of applications and requests in a manner that, in the opinion of the Minister, will best support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada. In carrying out its responsibilities under sections 94 and 87.3 of the IRPA, Canada is committed to working equitably with all interested parties, including New Brunswick. 2.1.3 Canada is responsible for the creation of immigration classes within the legislation; New Brunswick is responsible for the design, promotion, recruitment, administration, monitoring, evaluation and integrity of its Provincial Nominee Program, and may create categories within this program to the extent that these categories identify individuals solely on the basis of their ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick, and are compatible with the definitions and criteria applicable to the Provincial Nominee Class under the IRPA and the IRPR and with national immigration policy. 2.1.4 Canada will process Provincial Nominee applications from applicants nominated in all provinces and territories equitably and as expeditiously as possible, within the number of nomination certificates issued each calendar year, subject to the provisions of sections 3.4 and 9.2, operational and resource constraints and balancing multiple competing priorities, including any priorities which may arise as a result of Ministerial instructions issued under section 87.3 of the IRPA. 2.1.5 Canada and New Brunswick agree on the importance of the following shared principles: the Provincial Nominee Program as a strategic tool for significant economic benefit in the region; proactively encouraging immigration to Francophone Minority Communities in New Brunswick; communication and collaboration to ensure program integrity, effective management and successful outcomes; program integrity activities in maintaining the integrity of the Provincial ","3":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees2"},{"0":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees","1":"3","2":"Nominee Program; standardized methodology for all Provincial Nominee Program evaluations to ensure that performance information common to all jurisdictions is collected and evaluated in a comparable manner; and the Provincial Nominee Program as a tool for spreading the benefits of immigration across Canada and the critical role that the settlement and retention of provincial nominees in the nominating jurisdiction plays in achieving this goal. 2.1.6 Both Parties will consult in a timely manner on proposed changes to policies, legislation, regulations and programs which could have a significant impact, fiscal or otherwise, on the operation of New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program. 3.0 Planning and Reporting 3.1 New Brunswick will develop a Provincial Nominee Program plan based on the shared principles agreed to by the parties in section 2.1. New Brunswick may submit this plan to Canada on an annual basis, in advance of consultations, for consideration in developing Canada’s projections for Canada’s immigration levels planning. In establishing its Provincial Nominee Program plan, New Brunswick will consult with Canada, taking into account Canada’s role in national immigration policy and planning. 3.2 Canada will make all reasonable efforts to incorporate New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan into Canada’s immigration plan. 3.3 In establishing the number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations allocated to New Brunswick as part of Canada’s immigration plan, Canada may consider New Brunswick’s results in achieving the expected outcomes of the Provincial Nominee Program, including but not limited to: 3.3.1 New Brunswick’s ability to identify fraud; 3.3.2 New Brunswick’s ability to identify nominees on their ability to become economically established within New Brunswick; 3.3.3 New Brunswick’s ability to retain nominees in New Brunswick; and 3.3.4 New Brunswick’s ability to address provincial labour market and economic needs through the Provincial Nominee ","3":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees3"},{"0":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees","1":"4","2":"Program. 3.4 The number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations as set by Canada in consultation with New Brunswick, subject to the principles outlined in section 2.1, may be adjusted at any time during the year upon agreement by both Parties. By September 30, or periodically as agreed to by both Parties, New Brunswick will inform Canada of its progress in issuing nomination certificates for the current calendar year. 3.5 Reporting on New Brunswick’s levels planning will be undertaken as follows: 3.5.1 New Brunswick will provide Canada with an annual report for the preceding year on New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan and the results achieved based on calendar year, no later than four (4) weeks after receiving the specified format from Canada; and 3.5.2 The annual report will include but is not limited to the elements outlined in Schedule A. The province will amend the annual report, as required, to ensure that it includes performance indicators listed in the Provincial Nominee Program Performance Measurement framework outlined in section 7.2. 3.6 The Parties undertake to give one another notice, in a manner that is as timely as possible, of any change in procedure, policy, regulations or legislation relating to their respective programs or operations that is likely to affect the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.0 Assessment and Nomination 4.1 New Brunswick has the sole and non-transferable responsibility to assess and nominate candidates who, in New Brunswick’s determination: 4.1.1 will be of benefit to the economic development of New Brunswick; and 4.1.2 have the ability and intention to economically establish and permanently settle in New Brunswick subject to sections 4.3 through 4.11. 4.2 Canada shall consider New Brunswick’s nomination as evidence that New Brunswick has carried out its due diligence determining that an applicant has met the requirements of New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program. 4.3 In order to exercise its nomination authority ","3":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees4"},{"0":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees","1":"5","2":"under this Annex, New Brunswick will develop and use objective and transparent criteria for nomination which will assess the ability and intention of the applicant to become economically established in New Brunswick and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the Province. New Brunswick will codify and publish Provincial Nominee Program requirements, policy and procedures in publicly available directives. Applicants will be required to meet these criteria in order to be nominated. New Brunswick will respect the principles and objectives of this Annex in developing and implementing its criteria and procedures. 4.4 New Brunswick will provide Canada, in confidence, all necessary information regarding the criteria, policies and procedures that it has established for the categories under its Provincial Nominee Program, as outlined in stream design templates provided by Canada, prior to the introduction or modification of any Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project. Canada will conduct a review of any proposed changes and, if it has determined that the changes are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national immigration policies, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to the proposed changes. To the extent possible, the timing and duration of the review will be mutually agreed upon by Canada and New Brunswick prior to the start of the review process, taking into account resource constraints. While Canada will strive to undertake the review as expeditiously as possible, the period of this review will vary according to the complexity of the proposed changes. New Brunswick will only implement the new or amended Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project once Canada and New Brunswick have reached agreement. 4.5 Provincial Nominee applicants will be nominated solely on the basis of economic benefit to New Brunswick and their ability and intention of becoming economically established and permanently residing in New Brunswick. Economic ","3":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees5"},{"0":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees","1":"6","2":"establishment will be determined on the basis of factors such as: current job or job offer, language ability, work experience meeting critical skills shortages, education and training, and business ownership skills and past experience. 4.6 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, shall not constitute an eligibility condition. 4.7 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, may be considered as part of the assessment of the applicant's adaptability and intentions to reside in the nominating province. However, they shall not constitute a determining factor under any stream or category under the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.8 New Brunswick agrees to maintain the minimum language standards and mandatory testing implemented on July 1, 2012 for Provincial Nominees at Skill Level C and D of the National Occupational Classification 2016, or Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) category 4 and 5 of the National Occupational Classification 2021, and to work towards establishing minimum language standards and/or mandatory testing for all other Provincial Nominees. 4.8.1 For those streams, categories or occupations subject to minimum language standards and mandatory testing, New Brunswick will confirm that nominations are based on valid language test results. New Brunswick will require those applicants to have their proficiency assessed in the English or French language by an organization or institution designated by Canada and these applicants must have obtained proficiencies for their abilities to speak, listen, read and write that correspond to agreed upon benchmarks. Only language test results from an organization or institution designated by Canada and the correlation of those results with the agreed upon benchmarks will be accepted as evidence of the applicant’s proficiency in an official language for the purposes of this provision. The official ","3":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees6"},{"0":"Annex A: Provincial Nominees","1":"7","2":"notification of the results issued by the designated organization or a copy must be included with the application for permanent residence.

This creates a challenge for those who came to Canada as a minor but did not obtain permanent residence or citizenship and are now ineligible, including those who later committed crimes in Canada. Not all individuals who came to Canada as a minor obtained permanent residence or citizenship. Others have since lost their permanent resident status due to being inadmissible. Some of these individuals were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider under a provincial or territorial government’s designated ministry for child protection by court order as a minor in Canada. In some cases, permanent resident status or citizenship were not sought for these individuals when they were eligible and while under the legal responsibility of a child protection agency and, as a result, some individuals who are now inadmissible are facing deportation and an uncertain future. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the vulnerability of these individuals, and the particular risk they may face if deported to their country of nationality; a country with which they have little or no connection and of which they, often, do not speak the language as a result of living in Canada for many years. Public Policy Considerations In recognition of the vulnerability of certain individuals who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider, and may now face removal, this public policy will provide a pathway to permanent residence to eligible foreign nationals and their in-Canada family members.

November 1, 2023—Ottawa—Immigration drives Canada’s economy and fuels its future growth. As we continue to face an aging population and critical labour shortages in key sectors like health care, transportation and home building, newcomers are critical to help spur innovation, grow the economy, and support local businesses and communities. The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today tabled the 2024-2026 Immigration Levels Plan. This plan is tailored to support economic growth while balancing with the pressures in areas like housing, healthcare and infrastructure. It charts a responsible course for sustainable and stable population growth. With this Levels Plan, the Government of Canada is maintaining its target of 485,000 permanent residents for 2024 and completing the final step to reach 500,000 in 2025. Starting in 2026, the government will stabilize permanent resident levels at 500,000, allowing time for successful integration, while continuing to augment Canada’s labour market. The government also plans to take action over the next year to recalibrate the number of temporary resident admissions to ensure this aspect of our immigration system also remains sustainable. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with the provinces and territories, employers, stakeholders and Indigenous peoples to help Canada adapt to the realities of immigration-driven population growth.

Together, these measures will continue to put people at the heart of our immigration policy and ensure that newcomers have the resources they need, including settlement support and access to housing, to succeed in their new lives. Highlights of the 2024-2026 Immigration Levels Plan include: A continued long-term focus on economic growth, with over 60% of permanent resident admissions dedicated to the economic class by 2025. A commitment to uphold the Government of Canada’s humanitarian tradition support effort by responding to humanitarian and geopolitical crises around the world. New ambitious Francophone immigration targets to support Francophone communities outside of Quebec. The targets represent 6% of total immigration in 2024, 7% in 2025, and 8% in 2026. This is to strengthen Francophone communities outside of Quebec and ensure the economic prosperity of Francophone minority communities across Canada. The new Levels Plan also considers important progress IRCC has made in the past year through new digital systems and improved client service, which have increased processing capacity and reduced application backlogs. Through immigration, Canada will continue to help families stay together, bring the skills and talent we need to help companies grow their businesses, and maintain our humanitarian tradition, so that the country continues to benefit from the strength and diversity that newcomers bring to our communities.

Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Minister must table the Levels Plan in Parliament each year. The Levels Plan identifies permanent resident targets in four categories: economic immigration, family reunification, refugees and protected persons, and the humanitarian and compassionate class. IRCC is supporting employers through measures like category-based selection. As part of this initiative, IRCC is increasing the number of invitations to individuals with work experience in health care, STEM, transport, agriculture and agri-food, trades and French proficiency. On August 3, 2023, 1,500 invitations were sent to individuals with experience in the skilled trades (including carpenters, contractors, plumbers, etc.). Over the last five years, close to 38,000 tradespersons have obtained permanent residency in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class, the Provincial Nominee Program, and the Federal Skilled Trades program. Bringing in immigrants to fill labour market gaps will help Canada deliver on its National Housing Strategy, an ambitious 10-year plan that will invest more than $82 billion to give more Canadians a place to call home. Progress on programs and initiatives under this strategy is updated quarterly at www.placetocallhome.ca. Canada continues to be a global leader in refugee resettlement and labour mobility. Last year, Canada resettled more than 46,500 refugees from over 80 countries. In fact, in October 2023, Canada met its commitment to welcome at least 40,000 vulnerable Afghans.

January 16, 2024, Caraquet, New Brunswick—Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in Canada’s economic growth and promotes the vitality of Francophone minority communities and meet labour needs across the country. Today, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced in Caraquet, New Brunswick, a series of initiatives to support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. These measures include a new Francophone immigration policy, the renewal and expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, a new program to support Francophone immigration, and the implementation of the Action Plan for Official Languages—and they will all strengthen the presence of French in Canada.

Cap and provincial attestation letter As of 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024, most new post-secondary international students at the college or undergraduate level must provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from a province or territory with their study permit application. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will return any application received that does not include a PAL, unless otherwise exempt. This attestation will serve as proof that the student has been accounted for under a provincial or territorial allocation within the national cap.

Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) update for graduates of master’s degree programs In recognition that graduates of master’s degree granting programs are excellent candidates to succeed in Canada’s labour market and potentially transition to permanent residence, we have made a change to the length of the PGWP, so that they have the opportunity to meet the required Canadian work experience in order to apply for their permanent residence. Starting on February 15, 2024, a longer, 3-year post-graduation work permit will be available to those who are graduating from a master’s degree program that is less than 2 years and who meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. The length of PGWPs for programs other than master’s degrees will continue to align with the length of the study program, to a maximum of 3 years. Who is eligible for a longer post-graduation work permit (PGWP)? Graduates of programs that are at least two years in length at PGWP-eligible designated learning institutions are eligible for a 3-year PGWP, as are graduates of master’s degree programs less than 2 years in length. 3.

Who is eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? International students currently enrolled will remain eligible for a PGWP if they meet other program eligibility criteria. Who is not eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? New students enrolling in this type of program will not be eligible for a post-graduation work permit. 4. Changes to open work permit eligibility for spouses In the coming weeks, eligibility for open work permits for the spouses and common-law partners of international students will be updated. Who can get an open work permit? Eligibility is limited to the spouses and common-law partners of students in graduate (master’s and doctorate) and professional degree–granting programs only. Once these changes are in effect, spouses and common-law partners of international students seeking to extend their existing work permit will continue to be eligible under this stream. Who will not be eligible for an open work permit?

A Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) applicant may have a child who does not meet the definition of “dependent child” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), and therefore cannot be included in the application for permanent residence. If an economic development organization of a participating community decides to issue a recommendation to this dependant in their own right, this dependant will then have to submit their own application for permanent residence and will be assessed on the merits of their own ability to become economically established. Factors to examine when determining the ability to become economically established In cases where the officer is not satisfied that the issuance of a recommendation and the fulfilment of the selection criteria are sufficient indicators of an applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada, they may examine certain factors as part of the overall assessment to determine the applicant’s ability to become economically established. These factors may include current job or job offer language ability work experience education and training The weight given to these factors may vary on a case-by-case basis. For example, when an applicant has a high level of education such as a PhD and is nominated for a low-level service position, this mismatch may be acceptable if the job is an entry-level opportunity.

As a result, some of these vulnerable people who never had status—or lost it—are now at risk of being deported to their country of birth. After living in Canada for years, many have little or no connection to their country of birth, and often do not speak the language. Canada is committed to addressing the situation and providing fair and equal access to Canada’s immigration system. That’s why Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada introduced a public policy to provide a permanent residence pathway for individuals who came to Canada as minors, were placed in protective care, and never obtained permanent residence or citizenship status as a result. This public policy is in force until January 21, 2027. This new permanent residence pathway builds on previous measures introduced in fall 2023. As of September 29, 2023, through the introduction of new ministerial instructions, eligible individuals previously in child protection services have been able to apply for a temporary resident permit (TRP) and a work or study permit. The TRP provides temporary resident status and reduces the risk of removal from Canada. Those who were eligible for the TRP will now be able to apply for permanent residence through this pathway.

to become economically established in New Brunswick and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the Province. New Brunswick will codify and publish Provincial Nominee Program requirements, policy and procedures in publicly available directives. Applicants will be required to meet these criteria in order to be nominated. New Brunswick will respect the principles and objectives of this Annex in developing and implementing its criteria and procedures. 4.4 New Brunswick will provide Canada, in confidence, all necessary information regarding the criteria, policies and procedures that it has established for the categories under its Provincial Nominee Program, as outlined in stream design templates provided by Canada, prior to the introduction or modification of any Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project. Canada will conduct a review of any proposed changes and, if it has determined that the changes are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national immigration policies, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to the proposed changes. To the extent possible, the timing and duration of the review will be mutually agreed upon by Canada and New Brunswick prior to the start of the review process, taking into account resource constraints. While Canada will strive to undertake the review as expeditiously as possible, the period of this review will vary according to the complexity of the proposed changes.

For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory (LMIA exemption code T13). To help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP.

under the Bridging open work permit guidance. The following special program code should be used: CARE4411 (Caregivers – HCCP Pilot) CARE4412 (Caregivers – HSW Pilot) Application assessment Work permit applications are processed based on the information provided by the foreign national. If the foreign national has indicated on their work permit application that they are applying for an open work permit, officers must ensure that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements, regardless of whether an employer’s name is mentioned in the application. If it is clear that complex or contentious issues or concerns exist on the APR (for example, the APR is approved in principle, but further investigation on the client is required), the work permit application should be referred to a local office for additional review. Once satisfied that any complex or contentious issues have been resolved, the local office can issue the work permit following these same instructions. Important: Officers should ensure that both general and specific eligibility are met. Permanent residence application stage Express Entry or QSWC: Completeness check If a foreign national submits an e-APR using Express Entry or submits an application under the QSWC, they may apply for an open work permit using this administrative LMIA exemption code once they meet the General eligibility criteria. A BOWP can only be issued if the e-APR or QSWC application has passed the section R10 completeness check. As such, Express Entry applicants or QSWC applicants should submit their acknowledgement of receipt with their BOWP application. Before issuing a BOWP, officers must check the GCMS to ensure that the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) has reviewed the application and determined that it meets the requirements of a complete application as described in sections R10 and R12.01.

system","1":"0","2":"Updated temporary public policy to grant permanent residence to certain individuals in Canada who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were under the legal responsibility of the child protection system Background Individuals who apply for permanent residence in Canada are generally unable to obtain permanent resident status if they are inadmissible to Canada. This creates a challenge for those who came to Canada as a minor but did not obtain permanent residence or citizenship and are now ineligible, including those who later committed crimes in Canada. Not all individuals who came to Canada as a minor obtained permanent residence or citizenship. Others have since lost their permanent resident status due to being inadmissible. Some of these individuals were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider under a provincial or territorial government’s designated ministry for child protection by court order as a minor in Canada. In some cases, permanent resident status or citizenship were not sought for these individuals when they were eligible and while under the legal responsibility of a child protection agency and, as a result, some individuals who are now inadmissible are facing deportation and an uncertain future. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the vulnerability of these individuals, and the particular risk they may face if deported to their country of nationality; a country with which they have little or no connection and of which they, often, do not speak the language as a result of living in Canada for many years. Public Policy Considerations In recognition of the vulnerability of certain individuals who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider, and may now face removal, this public policy will provide a pathway to permanent residence to eligible foreign nationals and their in-Canada family members.

Canada’s immigration targets to support sustainable growth","1":"2","2":" a more collaborative approach to levels planning with our partners. Canada will continue to welcome newcomers and ensure that they are supported in their new lives.” – The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Quick facts The Levels Plan is a projection of how many permanent residents will be admitted to Canada in a given year and sets targets for overall admissions per immigration category. Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Minister must table the Levels Plan in Parliament each year. The Levels Plan identifies permanent resident targets in four categories: economic immigration, family reunification, refugees and protected persons, and the humanitarian and compassionate class. IRCC is supporting employers through measures like category-based selection. As part of this initiative, IRCC is increasing the number of invitations to individuals with work experience in health care, STEM, transport, agriculture and agri-food, trades and French proficiency. On August 3, 2023, 1,500 invitations were sent to individuals with experience in the skilled trades (including carpenters, contractors, plumbers, etc.). Over the last five years, close to 38,000 tradespersons have obtained permanent residency in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class, the Provincial Nominee Program, and the Federal Skilled Trades program. Bringing in immigrants to fill labour market gaps will help Canada deliver on its National Housing Strategy, an ambitious 10-year plan that will invest more than $82 billion to give more Canadians a place to call home. Progress on programs and initiatives under this strategy is updated quarterly at www.placetocallhome.ca. Canada continues to be a global leader in refugee resettlement and labour mobility.

communities and meet labour needs across the country. January 16, 2024, Caraquet, New Brunswick—Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in Canada’s economic growth and promotes the vitality of Francophone minority communities and meet labour needs across the country. Today, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced in Caraquet, New Brunswick, a series of initiatives to support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. These measures include a new Francophone immigration policy, the renewal and expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, a new program to support Francophone immigration, and the implementation of the Action Plan for Official Languages—and they will all strengthen the presence of French in Canada. Francophone immigration policy The new policy promotes the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities. It paves the way for tangible, ambitious and innovative actions in the short, medium and long term that will enable progress towards restoring and increasing the demographic weight of these communities. It is also based on a series of measures such as promotion and recruitment support efforts, both in Canada and abroad, particularly for specific lines of business, in order to address labour shortages. The policy will also oversee the development of a new program and new measures dedicated to Francophone economic immigration.

Francophone Immigration Support Program The new Francophone Immigration Support Program will fund innovative projects to eliminate barriers to Francophone immigration. This will make it easier for Francophone minority communities to participate in international promotion initiatives and support and recruit French-speaking candidates. The Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028 These initiatives are supported by an investment of over $137 million announced as part of the Government of Canada’s Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028. The implementation of all the measures in the action plan demonstrates the federal government’s firm commitment to the vitality of Francophone minority communities. The Minister also highlighted that the target of 4.4.% French-speaking resident admissions outside Quebec was surpassed in December 2023, reaching approximately 4.7% from January to December 2023, according to the currently available statistical data. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will be able to confirm the complete 2023 statistics by February 2024. Last November, IRCC announced ambitious, realistic and achievable targets for the next three years. The targets for Francophone immigrant admissions outside Quebec are 6% in 2024, 7% in 2025 and 8% in 2026. These measures will facilitate the strengthening, long-term growth and vitality of Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories, as well as key stakeholders, to strengthen these communities.

With the modernized Official Languages Act and the Action Plan 2023–2028, which has been in effect since this autumn, our government is implementing the necessary mechanisms and investments to achieve targets that are both ambitious and essential.” - The Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages Quick facts In April 2023, the Government of Canada announced the Action Plan for Official Languages 2023–2028: Protection-Promotion-Collaboration. The Government is committed to implementing the measures proposed in Pillar 1: Francophone Immigration: Towards the Re-establishment of the Demographic Weight of Francophones. Under the modernized Official Languages Act, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship is obligated to adopt a policy on Francophone immigration that includes objectives, targets, and indicators. In 2023, more than 19,600 French-speaking immigrants settled in Francophone communities outside Quebec. In November 2023, the Government of Canada announced nearly $85,000 in financial assistance for the Université de l’Ontario français. This investment supports the implementation of the Observatoire en immigration Francophone au Canada and contributes to Canada’s efforts to promote the reception and integration of Francophone immigrants.

to clarify the announcement of an intake cap on new international study permit applications and other changes. International students make important contributions to Canada’s campuses, communities and economy; however, we have seen unsustainable growth in the International Student Program in recent years. These recently announced reforms will support sustainable population growth in Canada and improve system integrity, while helping to ensure that international students have a positive experience in Canada. 1. Cap and provincial attestation letter As of 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024, most new post-secondary international students at the college or undergraduate level must provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from a province or territory with their study permit application. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will return any application received that does not include a PAL, unless otherwise exempt. This attestation will serve as proof that the student has been accounted for under a provincial or territorial allocation within the national cap. Provinces and territories have been asked to have a plan in place for issuing PALs by March 31, 2024. The Government of Canada is working with the Government of Quebec to determine how the certificat d’acceptation du Québec pour études could serve as a PAL. International students whose applications were received by IRCC before 8:30 a.m. on January 22, 2024, as well as those who have already been approved for a study permit and intend to travel to Canada for an upcoming program, do not need to take further action as a result of the cap.

Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) update for graduates of master’s degree programs In recognition that graduates of master’s degree granting programs are excellent candidates to succeed in Canada’s labour market and potentially transition to permanent residence, we have made a change to the length of the PGWP, so that they have the opportunity to meet the required Canadian work experience in order to apply for their permanent residence. Starting on February 15, 2024, a longer, 3-year post-graduation work permit will be available to those who are graduating from a master’s degree program that is less than 2 years and who meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. The length of PGWPs for programs other than master’s degrees will continue to align with the length of the study program, to a maximum of 3 years. Who is eligible for a longer post-graduation work permit (PGWP)? Graduates of programs that are at least two years in length at PGWP-eligible designated learning institutions are eligible for a 3-year PGWP, as are graduates of master’s degree programs less than 2 years in length. 3. PGWP eligibility for public-private partnership college programs Some provinces allow public colleges to license their curriculum to be delivered by an affiliated private college.

The Auditor General of Ontario has also raised concerns about a lack of oversight into program quality and student services at these institutions. As such, IRCC has made a change to restrict PGWPs for these institutions, anticipating that without the ability to apply for a PGWP, there will be a reduction in the number of international students enrolling in them. Who is eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? International students currently enrolled will remain eligible for a PGWP if they meet other program eligibility criteria. Who is not eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? New students enrolling in this type of program will not be eligible for a post-graduation work permit. 4. Changes to open work permit eligibility for spouses In the coming weeks, eligibility for open work permits for the spouses and common-law partners of international students will be updated. Who can get an open work permit? Eligibility is limited to the spouses and common-law partners of students in graduate (master’s and doctorate) and professional degree–granting programs only. Once these changes are in effect, spouses and common-law partners of international students seeking to extend their existing work permit will continue to be eligible under this stream. Who will not be eligible for an open work permit?

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders. The principal applicant must demonstrate they have the ability to become economically established. A Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) applicant may have a child who does not meet the definition of “dependent child” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), and therefore cannot be included in the application for permanent residence. If an economic development organization of a participating community decides to issue a recommendation to this dependant in their own right, this dependant will then have to submit their own application for permanent residence and will be assessed on the merits of their own ability to become economically established. Factors to examine when determining the ability to become economically established In cases where the officer is not satisfied that the issuance of a recommendation and the fulfilment of the selection criteria are sufficient indicators of an applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada, they may examine certain factors as part of the overall assessment to determine the applicant’s ability to become economically established. These factors may include current job or job offer language ability work experience education and training The weight given to these factors may vary on a case-by-case basis. For example, when an applicant has a high level of education such as a PhD and is nominated for a low-level service position, this mismatch may be acceptable if the job is an entry-level opportunity. If the same PhD applicant were nominated for a position as a welder and lacked the relevant training and work experience, there would be little alignment between their labour market intentions and their skills and abilities.

Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP)","1":"0","2":"Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP) This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders. EMPP is Canada’s model for refugee and displaced person labour mobility, and it aims to address Canadian labour shortages while providing durable solutions for refugees and displaced persons with the skills and qualifications that Canadian employers need. EMPP applicants will arrive in Canada with permanent residence status as economic immigrants and will be eligible for the full suite of settlement and integration services that are offered to all economic immigrants, including pre-arrival orientation and referral to in-Canada settlement services and supports. They are not, however, entitled to refugee resettlement assistance, as they are economic immigrants. This means that it is very important for them to be able to demonstrate that they can establish themselves and provide for their own basic needs and those of their family during their first year in Canada. Regional EMPP (formerly known simply as EMPP prior to the creation of Federal EMPP) allows applicants to apply through: Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) Note: Regional EMPP applications do not count toward other program level allocations for AIP, PNP or RNIP. Regional EMPP candidates differ from candidates applying directly to AIP, PNP or RNIP as they must meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the Public Policy to support the Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP) – Phase 2. Applicants also have access to EMPP-specific services. Federal EMPP is a pathway that allows applicants to apply through a dedicated Federal EMPP stream: A. Job offer steam B.

permanent residence pathway for former minors in protective care","1":"0","2":"Ottawa, January 23, 2024—A small number of individuals who came to Canada as minors never obtained permanent residence or citizenship while they were in the custody of child protection services. As a result, some of these vulnerable people who never had status—or lost it—are now at risk of being deported to their country of birth. After living in Canada for years, many have little or no connection to their country of birth, and often do not speak the language. Canada is committed to addressing the situation and providing fair and equal access to Canada’s immigration system. That’s why Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada introduced a public policy to provide a permanent residence pathway for individuals who came to Canada as minors, were placed in protective care, and never obtained permanent residence or citizenship status as a result. This public policy is in force until January 21, 2027. This new permanent residence pathway builds on previous measures introduced in fall 2023. As of September 29, 2023, through the introduction of new ministerial instructions, eligible individuals previously in child protection services have been able to apply for a temporary resident permit (TRP) and a work or study permit. The TRP provides temporary resident status and reduces the risk of removal from Canada. Those who were eligible for the TRP will now be able to apply for permanent residence through this pathway.

Due to Iran’s crackdown on protestors following the killing of Mahsa Amini, the Government of Canada introduced special measures to support Iranian temporary residents in Canada as well as Canadian citizens and permanent residents living in Iran. These special measures are now being extended until February 28, 2025. Under these special measures, Iranian nationals in Canada with valid temporary resident status can continue to study, work or visit family by applying for an extension of their status free of charge. They can also apply to move between temporary streams, from within Canada, at no cost. Additionally, Canadian citizens and Canadian permanent residents in Iran who wish to leave can continue to apply for passports and permanent resident travel documents for free.

In this situation, “province” legally refers to provinces and territories. Therefore, in these instructions, when “province” is used, it refers to both provinces and territories. A person may be issued a work permit without requiring an LMIA, if they have a valid nomination from a province (other than Quebec) for permanent residence and a job offer from an employer based in that province. Work permit applications that include a valid nomination from a province or territory are processed under paragraph 204(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations using the administrative LMIA exemption code T13. For Quebec cases, the legislative authority for the LMIA exemption is paragraph R205(a). For further information, see Quebec cases.

Expired nomination If the nomination is expired, the foreign national must include a copy of the acknowledgement of receipt letter with their work permit application confirming that IRCC has received the PNP permanent residence application before the nomination expired. Officers must verify that the PNP application is in the Global Case Management System (GCMS), or go through the Permanent Resident Digital Intake tool or the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) in Sydney if the permanent resident application is not in GCMS to ensure that the nomination has not been withdrawn by the province and that no adverse information is found regarding the file. Questions regarding nominations should be referred to the CIO in Sydney. Reminder: Officers should not request the nomination certificate from clients as provincial nominees are not issued a copy. Work permit issuance in GCMS Under the Application screen enter the following: Field Selection or input Case type 52– Employer-specific LMIA-exempt applications The Case type field must indicate “52”. No other case type will allow the correct linkage in GCMS.

(hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”), the Parties agree that the purpose of this Annex and its accompanying Schedules is to define the roles and responsibilities of Canada and New Brunswick in relation to the Provincial Nominee Class as described in section 87 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) and, in accordance with subsection 8(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), to establish provisions concerning the selection of and acquisition of immigration status by foreign nationals nominated by New Brunswick. 1.2 In the event of a conflict between this Annex and the IRPA, the IRPR, or Ministerial Instructions given under the IRPA, Canada and New Brunswick agree that the IRPA, the IRPR, or Ministerial instructions shall prevail. 1.3 The objectives of this Annex are: 1.3.1 To strengthen New Brunswick’s ability to enhance the economic benefits of immigration to the province taking into account New Brunswick’s economic priorities as well as the development of Francophone Minority Communities in the province; 1.3.2 To continue to support the increase of the number of French-Speaking Immigrants to New Brunswick; 1.3.3 To recognize that the Provincial Nominee Class, as established by subsection 87(1) of the IRPR and this Annex, provide for the establishment of a jointly administered immigration program, where: New Brunswick is responsible for: the recruitment, assessment and nomination of Provincial Nominees on the basis of their ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick; the promotion of New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program; the integrity of the New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program; and ensuring that effective performance monitoring and evaluation systems, consistent with the national Provincial Nominee Program Performance Measurement and Evaluation Frameworks, are in place in New Brunswick. Canada is responsible for: ensuring that applicants admitted under the Provincial Nominee Program have met the requirements of membership in the economic class as provided under the IRPA, and that they are assessed for nomination using criteria designed to determine their eligibility for consideration in the economic class; making the final selection and admissibility decisions and issuing visas; and ensuring that performance monitoring and evaluation systems are in place at the federal level to ensure that the national Provincial Nominee Program continues to meet its economic objectives. 1.3.4 To process New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominees for permanent residence as expeditiously as possible, taking into account: New Brunswick’s annual Provincial Nominee Program plan; Canada’s projected annual immigration levels plan as per section 94 of the IRPA; the number of provincial nomination certificates issued in each calendar year, as referred to in section 3.4; legislative and regulatory requirements, including eligibility, admissibility and Ministerial Instructions; and operational and resource constraints. 2.0 Shared Principles 2.1 Canada and New Brunswick agree to abide by and uphold the following shared principles: 2.1.1 New Brunswick is best positioned to: determine the specific economic and labour market needs of New Brunswick vis-à-vis immigration; and assess and nominate candidates that will meet these economic and labour market needs and have the ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick. 2.1.2 Canada is responsible for national immigration policy direction, the overall design and management of the movement of Permanent and Temporary Residents to Canada and, in accordance with section 94 of the IRPA, for the establishment of an annual immigration plan containing a projection of the number of immigrants to be admitted to Canada each year in total and in each immigrant category; and, in accordance with section 87.3 of the IRPA, for the processing of applications and requests in a manner that, in the opinion of the Minister, will best support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada. In carrying out its responsibilities under sections 94 and 87.3 of the IRPA, Canada is committed to working equitably with all interested parties, including New Brunswick. 2.1.3 Canada is responsible for the creation of immigration classes within the legislation; New Brunswick is responsible for the design, promotion, recruitment, administration, monitoring, evaluation and integrity of its Provincial Nominee Program, and may create categories within this program to the extent that these categories identify individuals solely on the basis of their ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick, and are compatible with the definitions and criteria applicable to the Provincial Nominee Class under the IRPA and the IRPR and with national immigration policy. 2.1.4 Canada will process Provincial Nominee applications from applicants nominated in all provinces and territories equitably and as expeditiously as possible, within the number of nomination certificates issued each calendar year, subject to the provisions of sections 3.4 and 9.2, operational and resource constraints and balancing multiple competing priorities, including any priorities which may arise as a result of Ministerial instructions issued under section 87.3 of the IRPA. 2.1.5 Canada and New Brunswick agree on the importance of the following shared principles: the Provincial Nominee Program as a strategic tool for significant economic benefit in the region; proactively encouraging immigration to Francophone Minority Communities in New Brunswick; communication and collaboration to ensure program integrity, effective management and successful outcomes; program integrity activities in maintaining the integrity of the Provincial Nominee Program; standardized methodology for all Provincial Nominee Program evaluations to ensure that performance information common to all jurisdictions is collected and evaluated in a comparable manner; and the Provincial Nominee Program as a tool for spreading the benefits of immigration across Canada and the critical role that the settlement and retention of provincial nominees in the nominating jurisdiction plays in achieving this goal. 2.1.6 Both Parties will consult in a timely manner on proposed changes to policies, legislation, regulations and programs which could have a significant impact, fiscal or otherwise, on the operation of New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program. 3.0 Planning and Reporting 3.1 New Brunswick will develop a Provincial Nominee Program plan based on the shared principles agreed to by the parties in section 2.1. New Brunswick may submit this plan to Canada on an annual basis, in advance of consultations, for consideration in developing Canada’s projections for Canada’s immigration levels planning. In establishing its Provincial Nominee Program plan, New Brunswick will consult with Canada, taking into account Canada’s role in national immigration policy and planning. 3.2 Canada will make all reasonable efforts to incorporate New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan into Canada’s immigration plan. 3.3 In establishing the number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations allocated to New Brunswick as part of Canada’s immigration plan, Canada may consider New Brunswick’s results in achieving the expected outcomes of the Provincial Nominee Program, including but not limited to: 3.3.1 New Brunswick’s ability to identify fraud; 3.3.2 New Brunswick’s ability to identify nominees on their ability to become economically established within New Brunswick; 3.3.3 New Brunswick’s ability to retain nominees in New Brunswick; and 3.3.4 New Brunswick’s ability to address provincial labour market and economic needs through the Provincial Nominee Program. 3.4 The number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations as set by Canada in consultation with New Brunswick, subject to the principles outlined in section 2.1, may be adjusted at any time during the year upon agreement by both Parties. By September 30, or periodically as agreed to by both Parties, New Brunswick will inform Canada of its progress in issuing nomination certificates for the current calendar year. 3.5 Reporting on New Brunswick’s levels planning will be undertaken as follows: 3.5.1 New Brunswick will provide Canada with an annual report for the preceding year on New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan and the results achieved based on calendar year, no later than four (4) weeks after receiving the specified format from Canada; and 3.5.2 The annual report will include but is not limited to the elements outlined in Schedule A. The province will amend the annual report, as required, to ensure that it includes performance indicators listed in the Provincial Nominee Program Performance Measurement framework outlined in section 7.2. 3.6 The Parties undertake to give one another notice, in a manner that is as timely as possible, of any change in procedure, policy, regulations or legislation relating to their respective programs or operations that is likely to affect the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.0 Assessment and Nomination 4.1 New Brunswick has the sole and non-transferable responsibility to assess and nominate candidates who, in New Brunswick’s determination: 4.1.1 will be of benefit to the economic development of New Brunswick; and 4.1.2 have the ability and intention to economically establish and permanently settle in New Brunswick subject to sections 4.3 through 4.11. 4.2 Canada shall consider New Brunswick’s nomination as evidence that New Brunswick has carried out its due diligence determining that an applicant has met the requirements of New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program. 4.3 In order to exercise its nomination authority under this Annex, New Brunswick will develop and use objective and transparent criteria for nomination which will assess the ability and intention of the applicant to become economically established in New Brunswick and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the Province. New Brunswick will codify and publish Provincial Nominee Program requirements, policy and procedures in publicly available directives. Applicants will be required to meet these criteria in order to be nominated. New Brunswick will respect the principles and objectives of this Annex in developing and implementing its criteria and procedures. 4.4 New Brunswick will provide Canada, in confidence, all necessary information regarding the criteria, policies and procedures that it has established for the categories under its Provincial Nominee Program, as outlined in stream design templates provided by Canada, prior to the introduction or modification of any Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project. Canada will conduct a review of any proposed changes and, if it has determined that the changes are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national immigration policies, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to the proposed changes. To the extent possible, the timing and duration of the review will be mutually agreed upon by Canada and New Brunswick prior to the start of the review process, taking into account resource constraints. While Canada will strive to undertake the review as expeditiously as possible, the period of this review will vary according to the complexity of the proposed changes. New Brunswick will only implement the new or amended Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project once Canada and New Brunswick have reached agreement. 4.5 Provincial Nominee applicants will be nominated solely on the basis of economic benefit to New Brunswick and their ability and intention of becoming economically established and permanently residing in New Brunswick. Economic establishment will be determined on the basis of factors such as: current job or job offer, language ability, work experience meeting critical skills shortages, education and training, and business ownership skills and past experience. 4.6 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, shall not constitute an eligibility condition. 4.7 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, may be considered as part of the assessment of the applicant's adaptability and intentions to reside in the nominating province. However, they shall not constitute a determining factor under any stream or category under the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.8 New Brunswick agrees to maintain the minimum language standards and mandatory testing implemented on July 1, 2012 for Provincial Nominees at Skill Level C and D of the National Occupational Classification 2016, or Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) category 4 and 5 of the National Occupational Classification 2021, and to work towards establishing minimum language standards and/or mandatory testing for all other Provincial Nominees. 4.8.1 For those streams, categories or occupations subject to minimum language standards and mandatory testing, New Brunswick will confirm that nominations are based on valid language test results. New Brunswick will require those applicants to have their proficiency assessed in the English or French language by an organization or institution designated by Canada and these applicants must have obtained proficiencies for their abilities to speak, listen, read and write that correspond to agreed upon benchmarks. Only language test results from an organization or institution designated by Canada and the correlation of those results with the agreed upon benchmarks will be accepted as evidence of the applicant’s proficiency in an official language for the purposes of this provision. The official notification of the results issued by the designated organization or a copy must be included with the application for permanent residence. The benchmarks are as follows: In the case of an applicant who has a job offer for an occupation listed in Skill Level C and D, or TEER category 4 or 5 of the National Occupational Classification, or has acquired work experience in one or more occupations that are listed in Skill Level C and D, or TEER category 4 or 5 of the National Occupational Classification matrix, applicants must have obtained proficiencies that correspond to the Canadian Language Benchmark of 4 or higher in each of the following competencies: speaking, listening, reading and writing. A time-limited exemption of this requirement for New Brunswick’s Critical Worker Pilot is authorized under Schedule B. 4.8.2 As applicants in other streams, categories or occupations become subject to minimum language standards and mandatory testing, New Brunswick will follow the same process as outlined in section 4.8.1 to ensure that these applicants have obtained proficiencies for their abilities to speak, listen, read and write that correspond to agreed upon benchmarks. 4.8.3 Applications for permanent residence which require the submission of language test results as per 4.8.1(a) and which do not include valid language test results or the language results do not meet the above requirements will be returned to the applicant. 4.9 In exercising its nomination authority under this Annex, New Brunswick will apply the criteria for nomination referred to in sections 4.1 through 4.8 and follow the policy and procedures established by New Brunswick, as amended from time to time, insofar as these criteria, policy and procedures are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR or any successor legislation and regulations, national immigration policies and the terms of the Agreement and this Annex. These criteria will be applied to all individuals applying under the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and New Brunswick does not have the authority to waive these criteria. 4.10 New Brunswick will not issue a nomination certificate to: 4.10.1 any person whose employment is likely to affect the settlement of any labour dispute or affect the employment of a person involved in such a dispute, or whose employment will adversely affect employment or training opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents in New Brunswick; 4.10.2 any person who intends to enter, has agreed to enter, or has entered into an “immigration-linked investment scheme” as described in section 87 of the IRPR, or its successor; 4.10.3 any person who New Brunswick does not determine will be of benefit to the economic development of New Brunswick; or 4.10.4 any person who does not have the ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick. 4.11 New Brunswick will make every reasonable effort to ensure the collection and verification of all documentation supporting a nomination is genuine, and will conduct due diligence as and when warranted to confirm the authenticity of documents supporting a nomination and the veracity of information provided. 4.12 New Brunswick will keep written or electronic records of its assessments of its nominees against those criteria for a minimum of six years from the date of nomination and share those records with Canada if requested to do so, subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement. 4.13 New Brunswick is responsible for ascertaining an applicant’s ability to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick, and will conduct due diligence to ensure the applicant’s ability to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Canada retains the right to request additional documentation from the nominee which supports the nominee’s ability and intention to become economically established and settle in New Brunswick and to substitute its evaluation of the applicant’s ability and intention to become economically established in Canada pursuant to subsection 87(3) of the IRPR. In exercising its responsibilities under sections 4.2 and 4.19 and sections 6.1 to 6.7, Canada may also seek clarification and request documentation from New Brunswick on its assessment, the record of which is required under section 4.11 and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. 4.14 New Brunswick will issue a dated nomination certificate, valid in accordance with New Brunswick’s administrative requirements, for each Provincial Nominee. The nomination certificate initial validity will not exceed six months. The nomination certificate will specify information including, but not limited to, the category under which the nomination has been made, as well as other information outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. For security reasons, New Brunswick will forward a record of the Confirmation of Nomination, by electronic means, to the location specified by Canada. A Confirmation of Nomination received directly from the candidate or other Parties will not be accepted as evidence of the nomination. Nominees must file an application for permanent residency within the time limit specified on the Confirmation of Nomination. 4.15 New Brunswick will not issue nomination certificates in excess of the annual amount established by Canada in section 3.4. 4.16 In accordance with section 12.5.3 of the Agreement, on a five-year schedule, New Brunswick will conduct an independent and objective audit of the activities required to implement sections 4.1 to 4.15 and 5.2 to 5.4 to assess whether the procedures which have been established and documented are respected and that adequate oversight mechanisms have been put in place for ongoing program monitoring and reporting, subject to the following conditions: 4.16.1 Audits will be consistent with the standards established by the Institute of Internal Auditors; 4.16.2 New Brunswick will consult with Canada on the terms of reference for the audit; 4.16.3 New Brunswick will provide the results of audits, including the management responses and associated action plans, to Canada; 4.16.4 New Brunswick will report to Canada on the status of the action plan agreed to by the province on an annual basis until the completion of all action items. Canada will not disclose the results of audits, including the management responses, without the consent of New Brunswick; 4.16.5 Following the audit as described in 4.16, New Brunswick or Canada may request a review of the Provincial Nominee Program streams currently in place. Should a review be requested by either party, New Brunswick agrees to provide Canada with information on the stream design, as required. Canada and New Brunswick will cooperate on an assessment of the stream following the processes identified in section 4.4 and, if it is determined that the streams are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national and provincial immigration policies and objectives, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to proceed without changes; and 4.16.6 New Brunswick shall undertake the audit as described in section 4.16 within one (1) year of the Agreement taking effect, unless such an activity was completed within the previous three (3) years. 4.17 Subject to sections 3.4 and 9.2, Canada agrees to process applicants nominated for Permanent Resident status by New Brunswick as expeditiously as possible with a view to achieving targets that have been integrated into Canada’s immigration levels plan, and to balancing multiple competing priorities, including those reflected in Ministerial Instructions issued under section 87.3 of the IRPA. 4.18 Canada will communicate the terms of this Annex to offices involved in the processing of Provincial Nominee Program cases to ensure consistent application of all principles agreed upon at processing offices. 4.19 Upon receipt of the application for permanent residence, together with the Confirmation of Nomination from New Brunswick, Canada will: 4.19.1 determine the eligibility of the nominee as a member of the Provincial Nominee Class pursuant to section 87 of the IRPR; 4.19.2 determine the admissibility of the nominee and the nominee’s family members with respect to legislative requirements; and 4.19.3 issue permanent resident visas to Provincial Nominees and accompanying family members who meet all the requirements of the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and the eligibility and admissibility requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR. 4.20 Should Canada determine that an individual nominated by New Brunswick is likely to be refused a permanent resident visa based on the requirements of membership in the Provincial Nominee Class as per the IRPR and this Annex, New Brunswick will be notified as soon as possible, taking into consideration local operating environments, and New Brunswick will be consulted regarding the reasons for possible refusal. 4.21 New Brunswick may raise concerns or seek clarification from the assessing office with respect to a potential refusal, where the refusal is based on a finding that the applicant does not satisfy the requirements for membership in the Provincial Nominee Class in accordance with the provisions of the IRPR, within sixty (60) days from the date of being advised by Canada. 4.22 In all cases where Canada determines that an individual nominated by New Brunswick does not meet the admissibility requirements of the IRPA, Canada will refuse without notifying New Brunswick before the final decision. Subject to privacy laws and to the extent consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick, Canada will forward a copy of the refusal letter to New Brunswick in a timely fashion. 4.23 Canada and New Brunswick are committed to working together to assure program integrity. Accordingly, where Canada has refused an applicant on the basis of misrepresentation under section 40 of the IRPA, Canada will share case-specific information as described in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. New Brunswick shall conduct a review of the relevant provincial application, in accordance with its policies and procedures. 5.0 Admission 5.1 New Brunswick may support the application for a work permit in the following instances: 5.1.1 where a nominee is employed or has a job offer and is urgently required by the employer; or 5.1.2 where a potential business nominee is required to enter Canada as a Temporary Resident in order to meet the requirements of the New Brunswick business stream. 5.2 For nominees specified under 5.1.1, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of employment: 5.2.1 the job offer is genuine, and not part-time or seasonal; 5.2.2 the individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.2.3 the individual is reasonably able to carry out the functions of the job offer; and 5.2.4 the employer is not in violation of the IRPA/IRPR, as notified by Canada, and/or New Brunswick employment standards, as notified by the provincial employment standards body. 5.3 For nominees specified under 5.1.1, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of a job offer: 5.3.1 the job offer is genuine, and not part-time or seasonal; 5.3.2 the individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.3.3 the individual is reasonably able to carry out the functions of the job offer; 5.3.4 that Canadians and Permanent Residents had been considered first to fill the job; and 5.3.5 the employer is not in violation of the IRPA/IRPR, as notified by Canada, and/or provincial employment standards, as notified by the provincial employment standards body. 5.4 For candidates specified under 5.1.2, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of a potential business nominee: 5.4.1 the proposed business is consistent with New Brunswick’s requirements, and that the business plan is economically plausible; 5.4.2 the applicant will actively engage in establishing the proposed business; 5.4.3 the applicant is reasonably able to carry out the functions of business ownership/management; and 5.4.4 in the case where an applicant is entering Canada on a work permit in order to establish a business and meet the requirements of nominations, that the applicant is likely to meet the requirements for nomination within the initial period authorized. 5.5 New Brunswick will keep written or electronic records of its assessments of due diligence described in sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 for a minimum of six years from the date of the issuance of a letter of support and will share those records with Canada if requested to do so, subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement. 5.6 In the case of a nominee with employment or a job offer, where New Brunswick has conducted the due diligence as described in section 5.2 or 5.3, and determined that entry of a foreign national under a work permit is of significant benefit to New Brunswick, the New Brunswick may support an application for a work permit pursuant to paragraph 204(c) of the IRPR with a letter indicating that: 5.6.1 the nominated individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.6.2 the job offer or employment is genuine and will create economic benefits or opportunities; 5.6.3 the employment is not part-time or seasonal; 5.6.4 the wages and working conditions of the employment would be sufficient to attract and retain Canadian citizens or permanent residents, as per New Brunswick prevailing wage rates; and 5.6.5 New Brunswick is requesting that Canada issue a work permit for a specific period to cover the duration of processing of the permanent resident application, which Canada will take into account when issuing a work permit. 5.7 Recognizing the administrative resources required by New Brunswick to issue letters in support of work permit applications under IRPR 204(c), Canada and New Brunswick agree to work towards streamlining the process for admission as a Temporary Resident. Should Canada, New Brunswick, and the other Canadian provinces and territories, agree to a new process for supporting admission of Temporary Residents, the new process will terminate and replace the process outlined under section 5 of this Annex. Canada further agrees to process Temporary Resident applications of applicants nominated for Permanent Resident status by New Brunswick, as expeditiously as possible and subject to operational and resource constraints and balancing multiple competing priorities, with a view to addressing urgent needs of employers. 5.8 Where New Brunswick is considering an application for nomination under the business category of the Provincial Nominee Program, has conducted due diligence as described in section 5.4, and has determined that entry of a foreign national under a work permit to carry out business activity is of significant benefit to New Brunswick, New Brunswick may support an application for a work permit pursuant to paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR with a letter indicating that: 5.8.1 the foreign national is being considered for nomination for permanent residence based on their assessed business plan to conduct business activity in the province; 5.8.2 New Brunswick has determined that the planned business activity will be of significant benefit to the province; and 5.8.3 New Brunswick is requesting that Canada issue a work permit for a specific period, up to a maximum of two (2) years, which Canada will take into account when issuing a work permit. 5.9 Where New Brunswick has provided a letter of support as described in section 5.8, New Brunswick acknowledges that Canada will complete an assessment of the foreign national’s work permit application against paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR. Canada will consider New Brunswick’s letter of support as evidence of New Brunswick’s assessment of economic benefit in making its own determination that the intended work would create or maintain significant social, cultural or economic benefits or opportunities for Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents. 5.10 Upon receipt of the application for a work permit under paragraph 204(c) of the IRPR, Canada will: 5.10.1 determine the eligibility of the applicant for a work permit pursuant to section 200 of the IRPR; 5.10.2 determine the admissibility of the applicant with respect to legislative requirements; and 5.10.3 issue a work permit to applicants who: meet all the requirements of the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and the eligibility and admissibility requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR, and have submitted with their work permit application a letter of support from New Brunswick as described in section 5.6. 5.11 Where a temporary work permit issued under section 5.10 of this Annex is due to expire and New Brunswick has nominated that foreign national and the foreign national has applied for permanent residence and has been found eligible, Canada may issue a work permit to that foreign national pursuant to paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR. 6.0 Program Integrity 6.1 Canada and New Brunswick have shared responsibility for program integrity in the administration of the Provincial Nominee Program. To ensure the integrity of the program, both Canada and New Brunswick will conduct both quality of decision-making and anti-fraud exercises on a periodic basis and will implement changes to the program as necessary in a timely manner. 6.2 Subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement, Canada and New Brunswick will cooperate to ensure the integrity of the Provincial Nominee Program, including, but not limited to, activities such as: 6.2.1 investigating potential program abuses to ensure the rigour and confidence of the immigration system; 6.2.2 sharing information including personal information and intelligence related to program abuses, subject to privacy laws and to the extent required by the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing between Canada and New Brunswick; 6.2.3 working collaboratively with other federal agencies, as required, to address issues related to admissibility, including anti-fraud activities, criminality and public safety; 6.2.4 coordinating and streamlining investigations involving both jurisdictions; and 6.2.5 conducting and disseminating research, and identifying knowledge gaps related to program integrity and quality assurance mechanisms. 6.3 Canada and New Brunswick will continuously seek to improve program integrity by acting upon knowledge gained through periodic program integrity and quality assurance activities, with an emphasis on: 6.3.1 identifying and evaluating risk inform","3":"0","index":1},{"0":"2023-06-28 00:00:00","1":"Bridging open work permits for certain economic class permanent residence applicants [R205(a) - A75] – International Mobility Program","2":"Bridging open work permits for certain economic class permanent residence applicants [R205(a) - A75] – International Mobility Program This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff.

The factors provided for each code demonstrate how the situation may meet the requirements of R205(a). Officers must also always be satisfied that all requirements of R200 are met. The administrative code A75 is the code under which the work of certain foreign nationals, who are already working in Canada and are able to maintain their employment and settle while transitioning to permanent residence, may create significant economic or social benefits. As such, the following foreign nationals do not qualify for a BOWP: foreign nationals in Canada under section R186 who are exempt from the work permit requirement, except those under paragraph R186(u). This cohort is not transitioning from a work permit to permanent residence. foreign nationals applying for a BOWP at a port of entry or visa office (as they have not yet been authorized to enter as a temporary resident under section A22). There is a significant benefit to applicants being physically in Canada and working while transitioning to permanent residence. spouses and dependants of principal permanent residence applicants. This cohort of foreign nationals has access to work permits under different LMIA exemption categories. foreign nationals who are inadmissible to Canada Documentary evidence Applicants for a BOWP must provide the following: a completed Application to Change Conditions, Extend my Stay or Remain in Canada as a Worker form [IMM 5710 (PDF, 442 KB)] The response to “What type of work permit are you applying for?” must be “Open Work Permit” to meet the eligibility requirements. payment of the work permit processing fee, the open work permit holder fee and, if applicable, the restoration fee proof that they have met the APR stage corresponding to their permanent residence class and application submission, as stated in the General eligibility section Applicants under the AFP, the caring for children class and the caring for people with high medical needs class are issued an approval in principle letter or eligibility letter upon receiving a positive eligibility assessment on their APR and must provide a copy of this letter with their open work permit application. Specific eligibility – Provincial nominees Foreign nationals in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) are eligible for a BOWP only if they provided with their application a copy of the nomination letter issued by the nominating province or territory that indicates their employment is unrestricted selected “Open Work Permit” on their application form For certain employer-driven streams in the PNP, the nominating province or territory may impose employment restrictions on a successful nominee until the person becomes a permanent resident. If employment restrictions are imposed, IRCC does not issue an open work permit to the foreign national under the BOWP LMIA exemption. For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory (LMIA exemption code T13). To help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP. Template letter Provinces and territories may include an employer or the name of the occupation and the National Occupational Classification (NOC) code and still indicate that there are no employment restrictions. In these cases, applicants are eligible for an open work permit, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria. A separate letter from the applicant or the nominating province to confirm that no employment restrictions exist should not be requested. Employment location (mandatory imposition of condition) When a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the PNP, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the nominating province. See Specific conditions related to temporary work Therefore, in the Global Case Management System (GCMS), the “Province of Destination” must be the nominating province. The “City of Destination” is the name of the province followed by “NES” (not elsewhere stated) to allow for work anywhere in the nominating province. For example: Province of Destination: AB City of Destination: Alberta NES Specific eligibility – Agri-Food Pilot BOWP applications for the Agri-Food Pilot (AFP) must be submitted online. Applicants must provide their approval in principle letter in the “Client Information” field with their online work permit application. Specific eligibility – Quebec skilled workers Under the terms of the Canada–Quebec Accord, Quebec is responsible for selecting applicants destined for the province of Quebec, and IRCC is responsible for determining admissibility. Those selected by the province are issued a Certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ). Applicants in the Quebec skilled workers class are eligible for a BOWP after a completeness check (R10). The CSQ must have been valid when the APR was submitted. Employment location When a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the QSWC, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the province of Quebec. See: Specific conditions related to temporary work Therefore, in the GCMS, the “Province of Destination” must be “QC,” and the “City of Destination” must be entered as Quebec NES (not elsewhere stated), as in the following example: Province of Destination: QC City of Destination: Quebec NES Work permit validity for QSWC QSWC processing times usually extend to 24 months or more. Therefore, to ensure that applicants do not have to submit multiple work permit extensions, the duration for the initial BOWP is 24 months or passport validity, whichever is shorter. Extensions, if needed, should be issued for 12 months. However, on a case-by-case basis, officers may use their discretion, depending on current processing times for QSWC permanent residence applications. Specific eligibility – Home Child Care Provider Pilot (HCCPP) or Home Support Worker Pilot (HSWP) Foreign nationals in the HCCPP or HSWP are eligible for a BOWP if they have received a positive eligibility decision (approval in principle) on their application for permanent residence after completing their qualifying work experience. Under the ministerial instructions dated June 18, 2019, applicants in the HCCPP or the HSWP had to complete 24 months of qualifying work experience. On April 30, 2023, the 24 months of experience was reduced to 12 months of qualifying experience. This change applies to all applications, including pending applications. The application should be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt from the requirement to submit an in-Canada application online under R9.4 or R9.5. How pilot applicants provide proof of their work experience depends on their category: Gaining experience category (Category A): Applicants complete 12 months of qualifying experience after being approved for an occupation-restricted work permit, then submit Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 2.26 MB) with evidence of qualifying work experience. Direct to permanent residence category (Category B): Applicants submit Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 2.26 MB) and evidence of work experience with their application for permanent residence. Important: In the case where a Category A applicant obtains the qualifying work experience before being issued a work permit under this administrative code, after passing eligibility on the PR application, assess the work permit under the Bridging open work permit guidance. The following special program code should be used: CARE4411 (Caregivers – HCCP Pilot) CARE4412 (Caregivers – HSW Pilot) Application assessment Work permit applications are processed based on the information provided by the foreign national. If the foreign national has indicated on their work permit application that they are applying for an open work permit, officers must ensure that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements, regardless of whether an employer’s name is mentioned in the application. If it is clear that complex or contentious issues or concerns exist on the APR (for example, the APR is approved in principle, but further investigation on the client is required), the work permit application should be referred to a local office for additional review. Once satisfied that any complex or contentious issues have been resolved, the local office can issue the work permit following these same instructions. Important: Officers should ensure that both general and specific eligibility are met. Permanent residence application stage Express Entry or QSWC: Completeness check If a foreign national submits an e-APR using Express Entry or submits an application under the QSWC, they may apply for an open work permit using this administrative LMIA exemption code once they meet the General eligibility criteria. A BOWP can only be issued if the e-APR or QSWC application has passed the section R10 completeness check. As such, Express Entry applicants or QSWC applicants should submit their acknowledgement of receipt with their BOWP application. Before issuing a BOWP, officers must check the GCMS to ensure that the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) has reviewed the application and determined that it meets the requirements of a complete application as described in sections R10 and R12.01. If the e-APR or QSWC APR is incomplete, the application for a BOWP must be refused. The open work permit holder fee should be refunded, but the processing fee can't be. Complete application: The CIO enters the following case note in GCMS: “R10 OK.” Incomplete application: The CIO cancels the e-APR and enter the following note in GCMS: “E-APR rejected as incomplete. Client not eligible for BOWP.” Non-Express Entry APR: Determining if a positive eligibility decision has been made If the paper APR under one of the qualifying economic classes was submitted outside Express Entry (except for applications under the QSWC), there must have been a positive eligibility assessment for the foreign national to be eligible for a BOWP. The positive eligibility assessment is considered to be made once the status of the “Eligibility” field in the GCMS is set to one of the following: For application received on or after January 1, 2015: “Passed” For applications received before January 1, 2015: “Met” See further requirements above under Specific eligibility – Provincial nominees and Specific Eligibility – Agri-Food Pilot. Applicants applying for a BOWP must include evidence that confirms they have met eligibility with their open work permit application. Renewals Subsequent requests from applicants to extend their stay on an unrestricted open work permit should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Final decision Approval On the Application screen, officers should confirm or enter the following information in the specified fields: Field Selection or Input Case Type 27 Under examination Exemption Code A75 Province of Destination For provincial nominees and QSWC only: employment must be limited to the province or territory of nomination City of Destination For provincial nominees and QSWC only: [Name of province] NES (not elsewhere stated) For example, Alberta NES, Quebec NES NOC 99999 Intended Occupation Open Employer Open Valid to 24 months from date of issue Conditions – Medical If no medical examination was completed, see Medical conditions to be imposed for open employer but occupation-restricted work permits Conditions - Location For PNP and QSWC applications, the following location condition must be imposed: Not authorized to work in any location other than stated. User Remark (mandatory) APR Pending For HCCPP or HSWP: Pending APR stage-2 approval / Caregiver pilot Important: In HCCPP or HSWP applications, the officer must input the User remark on the work permit. This remark, in addition to the case type code, ensures eligibility for continued health care coverage by the province or territory. Refusals If an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, they should record their reasons for the decision as per the instructions in: Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision. Family members Under the authority of subparagraph 205(c)(ii) of the IRPR, genuine accompanying spouses, common-law partners and dependant children are eligible for an open work permit under the administrative code C49 if the principal foreign national was issued a bridging open work permit under the administrative code A75.

This creates a challenge for those who came to Canada as a minor but did not obtain permanent residence or citizenship and are now ineligible, including those who later committed crimes in Canada. Not all individuals who came to Canada as a minor obtained permanent residence or citizenship. Others have since lost their permanent resident status due to being inadmissible. Some of these individuals were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider under a provincial or territorial government’s designated ministry for child protection by court order as a minor in Canada. In some cases, permanent resident status or citizenship were not sought for these individuals when they were eligible and while under the legal responsibility of a child protection agency and, as a result, some individuals who are now inadmissible are facing deportation and an uncertain future. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the vulnerability of these individuals, and the particular risk they may face if deported to their country of nationality; a country with which they have little or no connection and of which they, often, do not speak the language as a result of living in Canada for many years. Public Policy Considerations In recognition of the vulnerability of certain individuals who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider, and may now face removal, this public policy will provide a pathway to permanent residence to eligible foreign nationals and their in-Canada family members.

As we continue to face an aging population and critical labour shortages in key sectors like health care, transportation and home building, newcomers are critical to help spur innovation, grow the economy, and support local businesses and communities. November 1, 2023—Ottawa—Immigration drives Canada’s economy and fuels its future growth. As we continue to face an aging population and critical labour shortages in key sectors like health care, transportation and home building, newcomers are critical to help spur innovation, grow the economy, and support local businesses and communities. The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today tabled the 2024-2026 Immigration Levels Plan. This plan is tailored to support economic growth while balancing with the pressures in areas like housing, healthcare and infrastructure. It charts a responsible course for sustainable and stable population growth. With this Levels Plan, the Government of Canada is maintaining its target of 485,000 permanent residents for 2024 and completing the final step to reach 500,000 in 2025. Starting in 2026, the government will stabilize permanent resident levels at 500,000, allowing time for successful integration, while continuing to augment Canada’s labour market. The government also plans to take action over the next year to recalibrate the number of temporary resident admissions to ensure this aspect of our immigration system also remains sustainable. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with the provinces and territories, employers, stakeholders and Indigenous peoples to help Canada adapt to the realities of immigration-driven population growth. This approach is also guided by An Immigration System for Canada’s Future—a report that lays out a pathway to strengthen our immigration system for newcomers, businesses, and communities. Together, these measures will continue to put people at the heart of our immigration policy and ensure that newcomers have the resources they need, including settlement support and access to housing, to succeed in their new lives. Highlights of the 2024-2026 Immigration Levels Plan include: A continued long-term focus on economic growth, with over 60% of permanent resident admissions dedicated to the economic class by 2025. A commitment to uphold the Government of Canada’s humanitarian tradition support effort by responding to humanitarian and geopolitical crises around the world. New ambitious Francophone immigration targets to support Francophone communities outside of Quebec. The targets represent 6% of total immigration in 2024, 7% in 2025, and 8% in 2026. This is to strengthen Francophone communities outside of Quebec and ensure the economic prosperity of Francophone minority communities across Canada. The new Levels Plan also considers important progress IRCC has made in the past year through new digital systems and improved client service, which have increased processing capacity and reduced application backlogs. Through immigration, Canada will continue to help families stay together, bring the skills and talent we need to help companies grow their businesses, and maintain our humanitarian tradition, so that the country continues to benefit from the strength and diversity that newcomers bring to our communities. Quotes “Today’s Immigration Levels Plan for 2024-2026, sets out our targets for immigration over the next three years. By stabilizing the number of newcomers, we recognize that housing, infrastructure planning, and sustainable population growth need to be properly taken into account. Through this plan, we are striking the appropriate balance to grow Canada’s economy, while maintaining our humanitarian tradition, supporting Francophone immigration, and developing a more collaborative approach to levels planning with our partners. Canada will continue to welcome newcomers and ensure that they are supported in their new lives.” – The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Quick facts The Levels Plan is a projection of how many permanent residents will be admitted to Canada in a given year and sets targets for overall admissions per immigration category. Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Minister must table the Levels Plan in Parliament each year. The Levels Plan identifies permanent resident targets in four categories: economic immigration, family reunification, refugees and protected persons, and the humanitarian and compassionate class. IRCC is supporting employers through measures like category-based selection. As part of this initiative, IRCC is increasing the number of invitations to individuals with work experience in health care, STEM, transport, agriculture and agri-food, trades and French proficiency. On August 3, 2023, 1,500 invitations were sent to individuals with experience in the skilled trades (including carpenters, contractors, plumbers, etc.). Over the last five years, close to 38,000 tradespersons have obtained permanent residency in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class, the Provincial Nominee Program, and the Federal Skilled Trades program. Bringing in immigrants to fill labour market gaps will help Canada deliver on its National Housing Strategy, an ambitious 10-year plan that will invest more than $82 billion to give more Canadians a place to call home. Progress on programs and initiatives under this strategy is updated quarterly at www.placetocallhome.ca. Canada continues to be a global leader in refugee resettlement and labour mobility. Last year, Canada resettled more than 46,500 refugees from over 80 countries. In fact, in October 2023, Canada met its commitment to welcome at least 40,000 vulnerable Afghans. Ours is one of the largest Afghan resettlement programs in the world, and our work continues. The Levels Plan takes into account extensive engagement with provincial and territorial representatives, as well as public opinion research and consultations with various stakeholders, including businesses, community organizations, and educational institutions. The 2024 target of 485,000 new immigrants to Canada amounts to 1.2% of Canada’s current population. Canadians across the country can see how newcomers are benefiting local communities through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s Immigration Matters campaign. Under the Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec establishes its own immigration levels.

January 16, 2024, Caraquet, New Brunswick—Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in Canada’s economic growth and promotes the vitality of Francophone minority communities and meet labour needs across the country. Today, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced in Caraquet, New Brunswick, a series of initiatives to support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. These measures include a new Francophone immigration policy, the renewal and expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, a new program to support Francophone immigration, and the implementation of the Action Plan for Official Languages—and they will all strengthen the presence of French in Canada. Francophone immigration policy The new policy promotes the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities. It paves the way for tangible, ambitious and innovative actions in the short, medium and long term that will enable progress towards restoring and increasing the demographic weight of these communities. It is also based on a series of measures such as promotion and recruitment support efforts, both in Canada and abroad, particularly for specific lines of business, in order to address labour shortages. The policy will also oversee the development of a new program and new measures dedicated to Francophone economic immigration. Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative Through the renewal of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, 14 Canadian communities will continue to receive funding to foster the integration of French-speaking newcomers. The initiative’s expansion will enable the Government of Canada to select up to 10 additional communities that will, in turn, be able to create environments that support the economic and socio-cultural integration of French-speaking newcomers. Francophone Immigration Support Program The new Francophone Immigration Support Program will fund innovative projects to eliminate barriers to Francophone immigration. This will make it easier for Francophone minority communities to participate in international promotion initiatives and support and recruit French-speaking candidates. The Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028 These initiatives are supported by an investment of over $137 million announced as part of the Government of Canada’s Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028. The implementation of all the measures in the action plan demonstrates the federal government’s firm commitment to the vitality of Francophone minority communities. The Minister also highlighted that the target of 4.4.% French-speaking resident admissions outside Quebec was surpassed in December 2023, reaching approximately 4.7% from January to December 2023, according to the currently available statistical data. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will be able to confirm the complete 2023 statistics by February 2024. Last November, IRCC announced ambitious, realistic and achievable targets for the next three years. The targets for Francophone immigrant admissions outside Quebec are 6% in 2024, 7% in 2025 and 8% in 2026. These measures will facilitate the strengthening, long-term growth and vitality of Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories, as well as key stakeholders, to strengthen these communities. Quotes “Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in strengthening our national identity. The numerous measures we are implementing will attract skilled Francophone workers who will support the economic and cultural development of these communities. Our efforts to ensure the successful reception and integration of French-speaking newcomers support our unwavering commitment to restoring and increasing the demographic weight of Francophone minority communities.” - The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship “The measures announced today aimed at promoting Francophone immigration are fundamental for the future and sustainability of Francophone communities in minority situations across the country. With the modernized Official Languages Act and the Action Plan 2023–2028, which has been in effect since this autumn, our government is implementing the necessary mechanisms and investments to achieve targets that are both ambitious and essential.” - The Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages Quick facts In April 2023, the Government of Canada announced the Action Plan for Official Languages 2023–2028: Protection-Promotion-Collaboration. The Government is committed to implementing the measures proposed in Pillar 1: Francophone Immigration: Towards the Re-establishment of the Demographic Weight of Francophones. Under the modernized Official Languages Act, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship is obligated to adopt a policy on Francophone immigration that includes objectives, targets, and indicators. In 2023, more than 19,600 French-speaking immigrants settled in Francophone communities outside Quebec. In November 2023, the Government of Canada announced nearly $85,000 in financial assistance for the Université de l’Ontario français. This investment supports the implementation of the Observatoire en immigration Francophone au Canada and contributes to Canada’s efforts to promote the reception and integration of Francophone immigrants.

International students make important contributions to Canada’s campuses, communities and economy; however, we have seen unsustainable growth in the International Student Program in recent years. These recently announced reforms will support sustainable population growth in Canada and improve system integrity, while helping to ensure that international students have a positive experience in Canada. 1. Cap and provincial attestation letter As of 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024, most new post-secondary international students at the college or undergraduate level must provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from a province or territory with their study permit application. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will return any application received that does not include a PAL, unless otherwise exempt. This attestation will serve as proof that the student has been accounted for under a provincial or territorial allocation within the national cap. Provinces and territories have been asked to have a plan in place for issuing PALs by March 31, 2024. The Government of Canada is working with the Government of Quebec to determine how the certificat d’acceptation du Québec pour études could serve as a PAL. International students whose applications were received by IRCC before 8:30 a.m. on January 22, 2024, as well as those who have already been approved for a study permit and intend to travel to Canada for an upcoming program, do not need to take further action as a result of the cap. Who needs a provincial attestation letter? most post-secondary study permit applicants most non-degree granting graduate programs (for example, certificate programs and graduate diplomas) anyone else not included in the exception list below Who doesn’t need a provincial attestation letter? primary and secondary school students master’s or doctoral degree students in-Canada visiting or exchange students studying at a designated learning institution Corrected on February 27, 2024 in-Canada study permit and work permit holders (includes study permit holders applying for an extension) in-Canada family members of study permit or work permit holders students whose application we received before 8:30 a.m. EST on January 22, 2024 2. Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) update for graduates of master’s degree programs In recognition that graduates of master’s degree granting programs are excellent candidates to succeed in Canada’s labour market and potentially transition to permanent residence, we have made a change to the length of the PGWP, so that they have the opportunity to meet the required Canadian work experience in order to apply for their permanent residence. Starting on February 15, 2024, a longer, 3-year post-graduation work permit will be available to those who are graduating from a master’s degree program that is less than 2 years and who meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. The length of PGWPs for programs other than master’s degrees will continue to align with the length of the study program, to a maximum of 3 years. Who is eligible for a longer post-graduation work permit (PGWP)? Graduates of programs that are at least two years in length at PGWP-eligible designated learning institutions are eligible for a 3-year PGWP, as are graduates of master’s degree programs less than 2 years in length. 3. PGWP eligibility for public-private partnership college programs Some provinces allow public colleges to license their curriculum to be delivered by an affiliated private college. In these cases, students physically attend a private college, but graduate with a diploma from a public institution. Concerns have been raised with regard to the quality of education provided by these institutions, as well as the lack of sufficient student supports. The Auditor General of Ontario has also raised concerns about a lack of oversight into program quality and student services at these institutions. As such, IRCC has made a change to restrict PGWPs for these institutions, anticipating that without the ability to apply for a PGWP, there will be a reduction in the number of international students enrolling in them. Who is eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? International students currently enrolled will remain eligible for a PGWP if they meet other program eligibility criteria. Who is not eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? New students enrolling in this type of program will not be eligible for a post-graduation work permit. 4. Changes to open work permit eligibility for spouses In the coming weeks, eligibility for open work permits for the spouses and common-law partners of international students will be updated. Who can get an open work permit? Eligibility is limited to the spouses and common-law partners of students in graduate (master’s and doctorate) and professional degree–granting programs only. Once these changes are in effect, spouses and common-law partners of international students seeking to extend their existing work permit will continue to be eligible under this stream. Who will not be eligible for an open work permit? The spouses and common-law partners of international students in other levels of study, including undergraduate and college programs, will no longer be eligible for an open work permit unless they already hold an open work permit under this stream.

Pending Cabinet’s approval, we’ll complete the final step to reach 500,000 in 2025 and in 2026, we’ll stabilize permanent resident levels. This will allow new permanent residents to better integrate into our communities. It will also continue to meet the needs of Canada’s labour market. We launched a new Francophone immigration policy that promotes the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities, as well as a series of measures that support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. We launched an online portal that lets some permanent residence applicants apply online finalize their permanent residence get their permanent resident card without in-person interaction We launched an online application status tracker that lets some family class permanent residence applicants, sponsors and their representatives more easily check their application status online (in the spouse, partner and dependent child categories). We reduced the backlog of Express Entry applications. New applicants can expect their applications to be processed within 6 months. We’ll continue to review and improve our processes so we can eliminate steps, use technology to support our employees and speed up processing.

It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders. The principal applicant must demonstrate they have the ability to become economically established. A Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) applicant may have a child who does not meet the definition of “dependent child” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), and therefore cannot be included in the application for permanent residence. If an economic development organization of a participating community decides to issue a recommendation to this dependant in their own right, this dependant will then have to submit their own application for permanent residence and will be assessed on the merits of their own ability to become economically established. Factors to examine when determining the ability to become economically established In cases where the officer is not satisfied that the issuance of a recommendation and the fulfilment of the selection criteria are sufficient indicators of an applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada, they may examine certain factors as part of the overall assessment to determine the applicant’s ability to become economically established. These factors may include current job or job offer language ability work experience education and training The weight given to these factors may vary on a case-by-case basis. For example, when an applicant has a high level of education such as a PhD and is nominated for a low-level service position, this mismatch may be acceptable if the job is an entry-level opportunity. If the same PhD applicant were nominated for a position as a welder and lacked the relevant training and work experience, there would be little alignment between their labour market intentions and their skills and abilities. An indicator of the ability to become economically established is the applicant’s intention and ability to enter the labour market in order to fully support themselves. If the officer is not satisfied that the individual intends to enter the labour market, they should consider refusing the application. Critical in determining the applicant’s ability to become economically established is the officer’s comparison of the requirements of the occupation (indicated by the National Occupation Classification (NOC) in the submitted recommendation) with all of the information provided by the applicant. The officer must examine all information provided to ensure that there is consistency throughout the elements of the application before making a final determination. The applicant should be invited to address any concerns that arise, in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness.

As a result, some of these vulnerable people who never had status—or lost it—are now at risk of being deported to their country of birth. After living in Canada for years, many have little or no connection to their country of birth, and often do not speak the language. Canada is committed to addressing the situation and providing fair and equal access to Canada’s immigration system. That’s why Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada introduced a public policy to provide a permanent residence pathway for individuals who came to Canada as minors, were placed in protective care, and never obtained permanent residence or citizenship status as a result. This public policy is in force until January 21, 2027. This new permanent residence pathway builds on previous measures introduced in fall 2023. As of September 29, 2023, through the introduction of new ministerial instructions, eligible individuals previously in child protection services have been able to apply for a temporary resident permit (TRP) and a work or study permit. The TRP provides temporary resident status and reduces the risk of removal from Canada. Those who were eligible for the TRP will now be able to apply for permanent residence through this pathway.

In this situation, “province” legally refers to provinces and territories. Therefore, in these instructions, when “province” is used, it refers to both provinces and territories. A person may be issued a work permit without requiring an LMIA, if they have a valid nomination from a province (other than Quebec) for permanent residence and a job offer from an employer based in that province. Work permit applications that include a valid nomination from a province or territory are processed under paragraph 204(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations using the administrative LMIA exemption code T13.

Officers should check the client notes to verify the nomination has not been “paused” by the province of issuance (for example, a job offer has been withdrawn or the province is conducting an investigation). Documentary evidence The application for the work permit must include the following: an LMIA-exempt offer of employment submitted in the Employer Portal (or through an alternate submission if it was approved) and proof the employer has paid the employer compliance fee a copy of the confirmation of nomination letter from the provincial government that verifies that the foreign national has been nominated for permanent residence by the province Officers should not request the nomination certificate as provincial nominees are not issued a copy a statement from the province that it has determined that all factors required for the issuance of a work permit under paragraph R204(c) as per its agreement with Canada have been met The required factors include that the nominated individual is urgently required by the provincial-based employer that the job offer is genuine and will create economic benefits or opportunities that the employment is not part-time or seasonal that the wages and working conditions of the employment would be sufficient to attract and retain Canadian citizens or permanent residents Note: “Urgently required” means there should be no unreasonable delay between approval and start of employment. Applications that do not include the requested information will be refused since they do not meet the eligibility requirements under R204(c); they would require a LMIA.

In carrying out its responsibilities under sections 94 and 87.3 of the IRPA, Canada is committed to working equitably with all interested parties, including New Brunswick. 2.1.3 Canada is responsible for the creation of immigration classes within the legislation; New Brunswick is responsible for the design, promotion, recruitment, administration, monitoring, evaluation and integrity of its Provincial Nominee Program, and may create categories within this program to the extent that these categories identify individuals solely on the basis of their ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick, and are compatible with the definitions and criteria applicable to the Provincial Nominee Class under the IRPA and the IRPR and with national immigration policy. 2.1.4 Canada will process Provincial Nominee applications from applicants nominated in all provinces and territories equitably and as expeditiously as possible, within the number of nomination certificates issued each calendar year, subject to the provisions of sections 3.4 and 9.2, operational and resource constraints and balancing multiple competing priorities, including any priorities which may arise as a result of Ministerial instructions issued under section 87.3 of the IRPA. 2.1.5 Canada and New Brunswick agree on the importance of the following shared principles: the Provincial Nominee Program as a strategic tool for significant economic benefit in the region; proactively encouraging immigration to Francophone Minority Communities in New Brunswick; communication and collaboration to ensure program integrity, effective management and successful outcomes; program integrity activities in maintaining the integrity of the Provincial Nominee Program; standardized methodology for all Provincial Nominee Program evaluations to ensure that performance information common to all jurisdictions is collected and evaluated in a comparable manner; and the Provincial Nominee Program as a tool for spreading the benefits of immigration across Canada and the critical role that the settlement and retention of provincial nominees in the nominating jurisdiction plays in achieving this goal. 2.1.6 Both Parties will consult in a timely manner on proposed changes to policies, legislation, regulations and programs which could have a significant impact, fiscal or otherwise, on the operation of New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program. 3.0 Planning and Reporting 3.1 New Brunswick will develop a Provincial Nominee Program plan based on the shared principles agreed to by the parties in section 2.1. New Brunswick may submit this plan to Canada on an annual basis, in advance of consultations, for consideration in developing Canada’s projections for Canada’s immigration levels planning. In establishing its Provincial Nominee Program plan, New Brunswick will consult with Canada, taking into account Canada’s role in national immigration policy and planning. 3.2 Canada will make all reasonable efforts to incorporate New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan into Canada’s immigration plan. 3.3 In establishing the number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations allocated to New Brunswick as part of Canada’s immigration plan, Canada may consider New Brunswick’s results in achieving the expected outcomes of the Provincial Nominee Program, including but not limited to: 3.3.1 New Brunswick’s ability to identify fraud; 3.3.2 New Brunswick’s ability to identify nominees on their ability to become economically established within New Brunswick; 3.3.3 New Brunswick’s ability to retain nominees in New Brunswick; and 3.3.4 New Brunswick’s ability to address provincial labour market and economic needs through the Provincial Nominee Program. 3.4 The number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations as set by Canada in consultation with New Brunswick, subject to the principles outlined in section 2.1, may be adjusted at any time during the year upon agreement by both Parties. By September 30, or periodically as agreed to by both Parties, New Brunswick will inform Canada of its progress in issuing nomination certificates for the current calendar year. 3.5 Reporting on New Brunswick’s levels planning will be undertaken as follows: 3.5.1 New Brunswick will provide Canada with an annual report for the preceding year on New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan and the results achieved based on calendar year, no later than four (4) weeks after receiving the specified format from Canada; and 3.5.2 The annual report will include but is not limited to the elements outlined in Schedule A. The province will amend the annual report, as required, to ensure that it includes performance indicators listed in the Provincial Nominee Program Performance Measurement framework outlined in section 7.2. 3.6 The Parties undertake to give one another notice, in a manner that is as timely as possible, of any change in procedure, policy, regulations or legislation relating to their respective programs or operations that is likely to affect the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.0 Assessment and Nomination 4.1 New Brunswick has the sole and non-transferable responsibility to assess and nominate candidates who, in New Brunswick’s determination: 4.1.1 will be of benefit to the economic development of New Brunswick; and 4.1.2 have the ability and intention to economically establish and permanently settle in New Brunswick subject to sections 4.3 through 4.11. 4.2 Canada shall consider New Brunswick’s nomination as evidence that New Brunswick has carried out its due diligence determining that an applicant has met the requirements of New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program. 4.3 In order to exercise its nomination authority under this Annex, New Brunswick will develop and use objective and transparent criteria for nomination which will assess the ability and intention of the applicant to become economically established in New Brunswick and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the Province. New Brunswick will codify and publish Provincial Nominee Program requirements, policy and procedures in publicly available directives. Applicants will be required to meet these criteria in order to be nominated. New Brunswick will respect the principles and objectives of this Annex in developing and implementing its criteria and procedures. 4.4 New Brunswick will provide Canada, in confidence, all necessary information regarding the criteria, policies and procedures that it has established for the categories under its Provincial Nominee Program, as outlined in stream design templates provided by Canada, prior to the introduction or modification of any Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project. Canada will conduct a review of any proposed changes and, if it has determined that the changes are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national immigration policies, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to the proposed changes. To the extent possible, the timing and duration of the review will be mutually agreed upon by Canada and New Brunswick prior to the start of the review process, taking into account resource constraints. While Canada will strive to undertake the review as expeditiously as possible, the period of this review will vary according to the complexity of the proposed changes. New Brunswick will only implement the new or amended Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project once Canada and New Brunswick have reached agreement. 4.5 Provincial Nominee applicants will be nominated solely on the basis of economic benefit to New Brunswick and their ability and intention of becoming economically established and permanently residing in New Brunswick. Economic establishment will be determined on the basis of factors such as: current job or job offer, language ability, work experience meeting critical skills shortages, education and training, and business ownership skills and past experience. 4.6 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, shall not constitute an eligibility condition. 4.7 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, may be considered as part of the assessment of the applicant's adaptability and intentions to reside in the nominating province. However, they shall not constitute a determining factor under any stream or category under the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.8 New Brunswick agrees to maintain the minimum language standards and mandatory testing implemented on July 1, 2012 for Provincial Nominees at Skill Level C and D of the National Occupational Classification 2016, or Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) category 4 and 5 of the National Occupational Classification 2021, and to work towards establishing minimum language standards and/or mandatory testing for all other Provincial Nominees. 4.8.1 For those streams, categories or occupations subject to minimum language standards and mandatory testing, New Brunswick will confirm that nominations are based on valid language test results. New Brunswick will require those applicants to have their proficiency assessed in the English or French language by an organization or institution designated by Canada and these applicants must have obtained proficiencies for their abilities to speak, listen, read and write that correspond to agreed upon benchmarks. Only language test results from an organization or institution designated by Canada and the correlation of those results with the agreed upon benchmarks will be accepted as evidence of the applicant’s proficiency in an official language for the purposes of this provision. The official notification of the results issued by the designated organization or a copy must be included with the application for permanent residence. The benchmarks are as follows: In the case of an applicant who has a job offer for an occupation listed in Skill Level C and D, or TEER category 4 or 5 of the National Occupational Classification, or has acquired work experience in one or more occupations that are listed in Skill Level C and D, or TEER category 4 or 5 of the National Occupational Classification matrix, applicants must have obtained proficiencies that correspond to the Canadian Language Benchmark of 4 or higher in each of the following competencies: speaking, listening, reading and writing. A time-limited exemption of this requirement for New Brunswick’s Critical Worker Pilot is authorized under Schedule B. 4.8.2 As applicants in other streams, categories or occupations become subject to minimum language standards and mandatory testing, New Brunswick will follow the same process as outlined in section 4.8.1 to ensure that these applicants have obtained proficiencies for their abilities to speak, listen, read and write that correspond to agreed upon benchmarks. 4.8.3 Applications for permanent residence which require the submission of language test results as per 4.8.1(a) and which do not include valid language test results or the language results do not meet the above requirements will be returned to the applicant. 4.9 In exercising its nomination authority under this Annex, New Brunswick will apply the criteria for nomination referred to in sections 4.1 through 4.8 and follow the policy and procedures established by New Brunswick, as amended from time to time, insofar as these criteria, policy and procedures are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR or any successor legislation and regulations, national immigration policies and the terms of the Agreement and this Annex. These criteria will be applied to all individuals applying under the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and New Brunswick does not have the authority to waive these criteria. 4.10 New Brunswick will not issue a nomination certificate to: 4.10.1 any person whose employment is likely to affect the settlement of any labour dispute or affect the employment of a person involved in such a dispute, or whose employment will adversely affect employment or training opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents in New Brunswick; 4.10.2 any person who intends to enter, has agreed to enter, or has entered into an “immigration-linked investment scheme” as described in section 87 of the IRPR, or its successor; 4.10.3 any person who New Brunswick does not determine will be of benefit to the economic development of New Brunswick; or 4.10.4 any person who does not have the ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick. 4.11 New Brunswick will make every reasonable effort to ensure the collection and verification of all documentation supporting a nomination is genuine, and will conduct due diligence as and when warranted to confirm the authenticity of documents supporting a nomination and the veracity of information provided. 4.12 New Brunswick will keep written or electronic records of its assessments of its nominees against those criteria for a minimum of six years from the date of nomination and share those records with Canada if requested to do so, subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement. 4.13 New Brunswick is responsible for ascertaining an applicant’s ability to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick, and will conduct due diligence to ensure the applicant’s ability to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Canada retains the right to request additional documentation from the nominee which supports the nominee’s ability and intention to become economically established and settle in New Brunswick and to substitute its evaluation of the applicant’s ability and intention to become economically established in Canada pursuant to subsection 87(3) of the IRPR. In exercising its responsibilities under sections 4.2 and 4.19 and sections 6.1 to 6.7, Canada may also seek clarification and request documentation from New Brunswick on its assessment, the record of which is required under section 4.11 and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. 4.14 New Brunswick will issue a dated nomination certificate, valid in accordance with New Brunswick’s administrative requirements, for each Provincial Nominee. The nomination certificate initial validity will not exceed six months. The nomination certificate will specify information including, but not limited to, the category under which the nomination has been made, as well as other information outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. For security reasons, New Brunswick will forward a record of the Confirmation of Nomination, by electronic means, to the location specified by Canada. A Confirmation of Nomination received directly from the candidate or other Parties will not be accepted as evidence of the nomination. Nominees must file an application for permanent residency within the time limit specified on the Confirmation of Nomination. 4.15 New Brunswick will not issue nomination certificates in excess of the annual amount established by Canada in section 3.4. 4.16 In accordance with section 12.5.3 of the Agreement, on a five-year schedule, New Brunswick will conduct an independent and objective audit of the activities required to implement sections 4.1 to 4.15 and 5.2 to 5.4 to assess whether the procedures which have been established and documented are respected and that adequate oversight mechanisms have been put in place for ongoing program monitoring and reporting, subject to the following conditions: 4.16.1 Audits will be consistent with the standards established by the Institute of Internal Auditors; 4.16.2 New Brunswick will consult with Canada on the terms of reference for the audit; 4.16.3 New Brunswick will provide the results of audits, including the management responses and associated action plans, to Canada; 4.16.4 New Brunswick will report to Canada on the status of the action plan agreed to by the province on an annual basis until the completion of all action items. Canada will not disclose the results of audits, including the management responses, without the consent of New Brunswick; 4.16.5 Following the audit as described in 4.16, New Brunswick or Canada may request a review of the Provincial Nominee Program streams currently in place. Should a review be requested by either party, New Brunswick agrees to provide Canada with information on the stream design, as required. Canada and New Brunswick will cooperate on an assessment of the stream following the processes identified in section 4.4 and, if it is determined that the streams are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national and provincial immigration policies and objectives, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to proceed without changes; and 4.16.6 New Brunswick shall undertake the audit as described in section 4.16 within one (1) year of the Agreement taking effect, unless such an activity was completed within the previous three (3) years. 4.17 Subject to sections 3.4 and 9.2, Canada agrees to process applicants nominated for Permanent Resident status by New Brunswick as expeditiously as possible with a view to achieving targets that have been integrated into Canada’s immigration levels plan, and to balancing multiple competing priorities, including those reflected in Ministerial Instructions issued under section 87.3 of the IRPA. 4.18 Canada will communicate the terms of this Annex to offices involved in the processing of Provincial Nominee Program cases to ensure consistent application of all principles agreed upon at processing offices. 4.19 Upon receipt of the application for permanent residence, together with the Confirmation of Nomination from New Brunswick, Canada will: 4.19.1 determine the eligibility of the nominee as a member of the Provincial Nominee Class pursuant to section 87 of the IRPR; 4.19.2 determine the admissibility of the nominee and the nominee’s family members with respect to legislative requirements; and 4.19.3 issue permanent resident visas to Provincial Nominees and accompanying family members who meet all the requirements of the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and the eligibility and admissibility requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR. 4.20 Should Canada determine that an individual nominated by New Brunswick is likely to be refused a permanent resident visa based on the requirements of membership in the Provincial Nominee Class as per the IRPR and this Annex, New Brunswick will be notified as soon as possible, taking into consideration local operating environments, and New Brunswick will be consulted regarding the reasons for possible refusal. 4.21 New Brunswick may raise concerns or seek clarification from the assessing office with respect to a potential refusal, where the refusal is based on a finding that the applicant does not satisfy the requirements for membership in the Provincial Nominee Class in accordance with the provisions of the IRPR, within sixty (60) days from the date of being advised by Canada. 4.22 In all cases where Canada determines that an individual nominated by New Brunswick does not meet the admissibility requirements of the IRPA, Canada will refuse without notifying New Brunswick before the final decision. Subject to privacy laws and to the extent consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick, Canada will forward a copy of the refusal letter to New Brunswick in a timely fashion. 4.23 Canada and New Brunswick are committed to working together to assure program integrity. Accordingly, where Canada has refused an applicant on the basis of misrepresentation under section 40 of the IRPA, Canada will share case-specific information as described in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. New Brunswick shall conduct a review of the relevant provincial application, in accordance with its policies and procedures. 5.0 Admission 5.1 New Brunswick may support the application for a work permit in the following instances: 5.1.1 where a nominee is employed or has a job offer and is urgently required by the employer; or 5.1.2 where a potential business nominee is required to enter Canada as a Temporary Resident in order to meet the requirements of the New Brunswick business stream. 5.2 For nominees specified under 5.1.1, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of employment: 5.2.1 the job offer is genuine, and not part-time or seasonal; 5.2.2 the individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.2.3 the individual is reasonably able to carry out the functions of the job offer; and 5.2.4 the employer is not in violation of the IRPA/IRPR, as notified by Canada, and/or New Brunswick employment standards, as notified by the provincial employment standards body. 5.3 For nominees specified under 5.1.1, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of a job offer: 5.3.1 the job offer is genuine, and not part-time or seasonal; 5.3.2 the individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.3.3 the individual is reasonably able to carry out the functions of the job offer; 5.3.4 that Canadians and Permanent Residents had been considered first to fill the job; and 5.3.5 the employer is not in violation of the IRPA/IRPR, as notified by Canada, and/or provincial employment standards, as notified by the provincial employment standards body. 5.4 For candidates specified under 5.1.2, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of a potential business nominee: 5.4.1 the proposed business is consistent with New Brunswick’s requirements, and that the business plan is economically plausible; 5.4.2 the applicant will actively engage in establishing the proposed business; 5.4.3 the applicant is reasonably able to carry out the functions of business ownership/management; and 5.4.4 in the case where an applicant is entering Canada on a work permit in order to establish a business and meet the requirements of nominations, that the applicant is likely to meet the requirements for nomination within the initial period authorized. 5.5 New Brunswick will keep written or electronic records of its assessments of due diligence described in sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 for a minimum of six years from the date of the issuance of a letter of support and will share those records with Canada if requested to do so, subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement. 5.6 In the case of a nominee with employment or a job offer, where New Brunswick has conducted the due diligence as described in section 5.2 or 5.3, and determined that entry of a foreign national under a work permit is of significant benefit to New Brunswick, the New Brunswick may support an application for a work permit pursuant to paragraph 204(c) of the IRPR with a letter indicating that: 5.6.1 the nominated individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.6.2 the job offer or employment is genuine and will create economic benefits or opportunities; 5.6.3 the employment is not part-time or seasonal; 5.6.4 the wages and working conditions of the employment would be sufficient to attract and retain Canadian citizens or permanent residents, as per New Brunswick prevailing wage rates; and 5.6.5 New Brunswick is requesting that Canada issue a work permit for a specific period to cover the duration of processing of the permanent resident application, which Canada will take into account when issuing a work permit. 5.7 Recognizing the administrative resources required by New Brunswick to issue letters in support of work permit applications under IRPR 204(c), Canada and New Brunswick agree to work towards streamlining the process for admission as a Temporary Resident. Should Canada, New Brunswick, and the other Canadian provinces and territories, agree to a new process for supporting admission of Temporary Residents, the new process will terminate and replace the process outlined under section 5 of this Annex. Canada further agrees to process Temporary Resident applications of applicants nominated for Permanent Resident status by New Brunswick, as expeditiously as possible and subject to operational and resource constraints and balancing multiple competing priorities, with a view to addressing urgent needs of employers. 5.8 Where New Brunswick is considering an application for nomination under the business category of the Provincial Nominee Program, has conducted due diligence as described in section 5.4, and has determined that entry of a foreign national under a work permit to carry out business activity is of significant benefit to New Brunswick, New Brunswick may support an application for a work permit pursuant to paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR with a letter indicating that: 5.8.1 the foreign national is being considered for nomination for permanent residence based on their assessed business plan to conduct business activity in the province; 5.8.2 New Brunswick has determined that the planned business activity will be of significant benefit to the province; and 5.8.3 New Brunswick is requesting that Canada issue a work permit for a specific period, up to a maximum of two (2) years, which Canada will take into account when issuing a work permit. 5.9 Where New Brunswick has provided a letter of support as described in section 5.8, New Brunswick acknowledges that Canada will complete an assessment of the foreign national’s work permit application against paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR.

The factors provided for each code demonstrate how the situation may meet the requirements of R205(a). Officers must also always be satisfied that all requirements of R200 are met. The administrative code A75 is the code under which the work of certain foreign nationals, who are already working in Canada and are able to maintain their employment and settle while transitioning to permanent residence, may create significant economic or social benefits. As such, the following foreign nationals do not qualify for a BOWP: foreign nationals in Canada under section R186 who are exempt from the work permit requirement, except those under paragraph R186(u). This cohort is not transitioning from a work permit to permanent residence. foreign nationals applying for a BOWP at a port of entry or visa office (as they have not yet been authorized to enter as a temporary resident under section A22).

If employment restrictions are imposed, IRCC does not issue an open work permit to the foreign national under the BOWP LMIA exemption. For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory (LMIA exemption code T13). To help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP. Template letter Provinces and territories may include an employer or the name of the occupation and the National Occupational Classification (NOC) code and still indicate that there are no employment restrictions. In these cases, applicants are eligible for an open work permit, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria. A separate letter from the applicant or the nominating province to confirm that no employment restrictions exist should not be requested. Employment location (mandatory imposition of condition) When a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the PNP, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the nominating province. See Specific conditions related to temporary work Therefore, in the Global Case Management System (GCMS), the “Province of Destination” must be the nominating province. The “City of Destination” is the name of the province followed by “NES” (not elsewhere stated) to allow for work anywhere in the nominating province. For example: Province of Destination: AB City of Destination: Alberta NES Specific eligibility – Agri-Food Pilot BOWP applications for the Agri-Food Pilot (AFP) must be submitted online. Applicants must provide their approval in principle letter in the “Client Information” field with their online work permit application. Specific eligibility – Quebec skilled workers Under the terms of the Canada–Quebec Accord, Quebec is responsible for selecting applicants destined for the province of Quebec, and IRCC is responsible for determining admissibility. Those selected by the province are issued a Certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ). Applicants in the Quebec skilled workers class are eligible for a BOWP after a completeness check (R10). The CSQ must have been valid when the APR was submitted. Employment location When a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the QSWC, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the province of Quebec. See: Specific conditions related to temporary work Therefore, in the GCMS, the “Province of Destination” must be “QC,” and the “City of Destination” must be entered as Quebec NES (not elsewhere stated), as in the following example: Province of Destination: QC City of Destination: Quebec NES Work permit validity for QSWC QSWC processing times usually extend to 24 months or more. Therefore, to ensure that applicants do not have to submit multiple work permit extensions, the duration for the initial BOWP is 24 months or passport validity, whichever is shorter. Extensions, if needed, should be issued for 12 months. However, on a case-by-case basis, officers may use their discretion, depending on current processing times for QSWC permanent residence applications. Specific eligibility – Home Child Care Provider Pilot (HCCPP) or Home Support Worker Pilot (HSWP) Foreign nationals in the HCCPP or HSWP are eligible for a BOWP if they have received a positive eligibility decision (approval in principle) on their application for permanent residence after completing their qualifying work experience. Under the ministerial instructions dated June 18, 2019, applicants in the HCCPP or the HSWP had to complete 24 months of qualifying work experience. On April 30, 2023, the 24 months of experience was reduced to 12 months of qualifying experience. This change applies to all applications, including pending applications. The application should be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt from the requirement to submit an in-Canada application online under R9.4 or R9.5. How pilot applicants provide proof of their work experience depends on their category: Gaining experience category (Category A): Applicants complete 12 months of qualifying experience after being approved for an occupation-restricted work permit, then submit Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 2.26 MB) with evidence of qualifying work experience. Direct to permanent residence category (Category B): Applicants submit Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 2.26 MB) and evidence of work experience with their application for permanent residence.

If employment restrictions are imposed, IRCC does not issue an open work permit to the foreign national under the BOWP LMIA exemption. For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory (LMIA exemption code T13). To help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP. Template letter Provinces and territories may include an employer or the name of the occupation and the National Occupational Classification (NOC) code and still indicate that there are no employment restrictions.

As we continue to face an aging population and critical labour shortages in key sectors like health care, transportation and home building, newcomers are critical to help spur innovation, grow the economy, and support local businesses and communities. November 1, 2023—Ottawa—Immigration drives Canada’s economy and fuels its future growth. As we continue to face an aging population and critical labour shortages in key sectors like health care, transportation and home building, newcomers are critical to help spur innovation, grow the economy, and support local businesses and communities. The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today tabled the 2024-2026 Immigration Levels Plan. This plan is tailored to support economic growth while balancing with the pressures in areas like housing, healthcare and infrastructure. It charts a responsible course for sustainable and stable population growth. With this Levels Plan, the Government of Canada is maintaining its target of 485,000 permanent residents for 2024 and completing the final step to reach 500,000 in 2025. Starting in 2026, the government will stabilize permanent resident levels at 500,000, allowing time for successful integration, while continuing to augment Canada’s labour market. The government also plans to take action over the next year to recalibrate the number of temporary resident admissions to ensure this aspect of our immigration system also remains sustainable. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with the provinces and territories, employers, stakeholders and Indigenous peoples to help Canada adapt to the realities of immigration-driven population growth. This approach is also guided by An Immigration System for Canada’s Future—a report that lays out a pathway to strengthen our immigration system for newcomers, businesses, and communities. Together, these measures will continue to put people at the heart of our immigration policy and ensure that newcomers have the resources they need, including settlement support and access to housing, to succeed in their new lives. Highlights of the 2024-2026 Immigration Levels Plan include: A continued long-term focus on economic growth, with over 60% of permanent resident admissions dedicated to the economic class by 2025. A commitment to uphold the Government of Canada’s humanitarian tradition support effort by responding to humanitarian and geopolitical crises around the world. New ambitious Francophone immigration targets to support Francophone communities outside of Quebec. The targets represent 6% of total immigration in 2024, 7% in 2025, and 8% in 2026. This is to strengthen Francophone communities outside of Quebec and ensure the economic prosperity of Francophone minority communities across Canada. The new Levels Plan also considers important progress IRCC has made in the past year through new digital systems and improved client service, which have increased processing capacity and reduced application backlogs. Through immigration, Canada will continue to help families stay together, bring the skills and talent we need to help companies grow their businesses, and maintain our humanitarian tradition, so that the country continues to benefit from the strength and diversity that newcomers bring to our communities. Quotes “Today’s Immigration Levels Plan for 2024-2026, sets out our targets for immigration over the next three years. By stabilizing the number of newcomers, we recognize that housing, infrastructure planning, and sustainable population growth need to be properly taken into account. Through this plan, we are striking the appropriate balance to grow Canada’s economy, while maintaining our humanitarian tradition, supporting Francophone immigration, and developing a more collaborative approach to levels planning with our partners. Canada will continue to welcome newcomers and ensure that they are supported in their new lives.” – The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Quick facts The Levels Plan is a projection of how many permanent residents will be admitted to Canada in a given year and sets targets for overall admissions per immigration category. Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Minister must table the Levels Plan in Parliament each year. The Levels Plan identifies permanent resident targets in four categories: economic immigration, family reunification, refugees and protected persons, and the humanitarian and compassionate class. IRCC is supporting employers through measures like category-based selection. As part of this initiative, IRCC is increasing the number of invitations to individuals with work experience in health care, STEM, transport, agriculture and agri-food, trades and French proficiency. On August 3, 2023, 1,500 invitations were sent to individuals with experience in the skilled trades (including carpenters, contractors, plumbers, etc.). Over the last five years, close to 38,000 tradespersons have obtained permanent residency in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class, the Provincial Nominee Program, and the Federal Skilled Trades program. Bringing in immigrants to fill labour market gaps will help Canada deliver on its National Housing Strategy, an ambitious 10-year plan that will invest more than $82 billion to give more Canadians a place to call home. Progress on programs and initiatives under this strategy is updated quarterly at www.placetocallhome.ca. Canada continues to be a global leader in refugee resettlement and labour mobility. Last year, Canada resettled more than 46,500 refugees from over 80 countries. In fact, in October 2023, Canada met its commitment to welcome at least 40,000 vulnerable Afghans. Ours is one of the largest Afghan resettlement programs in the world, and our work continues. The Levels Plan takes into account extensive engagement with provincial and territorial representatives, as well as public opinion research and consultations with various stakeholders, including businesses, community organizations, and educational institutions. The 2024 target of 485,000 new immigrants to Canada amounts to 1.2% of Canada’s current population. Canadians across the country can see how newcomers are benefiting local communities through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s Immigration Matters campaign. Under the Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec establishes its own immigration levels.

January 16, 2024, Caraquet, New Brunswick—Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in Canada’s economic growth and promotes the vitality of Francophone minority communities and meet labour needs across the country. Today, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced in Caraquet, New Brunswick, a series of initiatives to support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. These measures include a new Francophone immigration policy, the renewal and expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, a new program to support Francophone immigration, and the implementation of the Action Plan for Official Languages—and they will all strengthen the presence of French in Canada. Francophone immigration policy The new policy promotes the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities. It paves the way for tangible, ambitious and innovative actions in the short, medium and long term that will enable progress towards restoring and increasing the demographic weight of these communities. It is also based on a series of measures such as promotion and recruitment support efforts, both in Canada and abroad, particularly for specific lines of business, in order to address labour shortages. The policy will also oversee the development of a new program and new measures dedicated to Francophone economic immigration. Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative Through the renewal of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, 14 Canadian communities will continue to receive funding to foster the integration of French-speaking newcomers. The initiative’s expansion will enable the Government of Canada to select up to 10 additional communities that will, in turn, be able to create environments that support the economic and socio-cultural integration of French-speaking newcomers. Francophone Immigration Support Program The new Francophone Immigration Support Program will fund innovative projects to eliminate barriers to Francophone immigration. This will make it easier for Francophone minority communities to participate in international promotion initiatives and support and recruit French-speaking candidates. The Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028 These initiatives are supported by an investment of over $137 million announced as part of the Government of Canada’s Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028. The implementation of all the measures in the action plan demonstrates the federal government’s firm commitment to the vitality of Francophone minority communities. The Minister also highlighted that the target of 4.4.% French-speaking resident admissions outside Quebec was surpassed in December 2023, reaching approximately 4.7% from January to December 2023, according to the currently available statistical data. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will be able to confirm the complete 2023 statistics by February 2024. Last November, IRCC announced ambitious, realistic and achievable targets for the next three years. The targets for Francophone immigrant admissions outside Quebec are 6% in 2024, 7% in 2025 and 8% in 2026. These measures will facilitate the strengthening, long-term growth and vitality of Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories, as well as key stakeholders, to strengthen these communities. Quotes “Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in strengthening our national identity. The numerous measures we are implementing will attract skilled Francophone workers who will support the economic and cultural development of these communities. Our efforts to ensure the successful reception and integration of French-speaking newcomers support our unwavering commitment to restoring and increasing the demographic weight of Francophone minority communities.” - The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship “The measures announced today aimed at promoting Francophone immigration are fundamental for the future and sustainability of Francophone communities in minority situations across the country.

International students make important contributions to Canada’s campuses, communities and economy; however, we have seen unsustainable growth in the International Student Program in recent years. These recently announced reforms will support sustainable population growth in Canada and improve system integrity, while helping to ensure that international students have a positive experience in Canada. 1. Cap and provincial attestation letter As of 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024, most new post-secondary international students at the college or undergraduate level must provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from a province or territory with their study permit application. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will return any application received that does not include a PAL, unless otherwise exempt. This attestation will serve as proof that the student has been accounted for under a provincial or territorial allocation within the national cap. Provinces and territories have been asked to have a plan in place for issuing PALs by March 31, 2024. The Government of Canada is working with the Government of Quebec to determine how the certificat d’acceptation du Québec pour études could serve as a PAL. International students whose applications were received by IRCC before 8:30 a.m. on January 22, 2024, as well as those who have already been approved for a study permit and intend to travel to Canada for an upcoming program, do not need to take further action as a result of the cap. Who needs a provincial attestation letter? most post-secondary study permit applicants most non-degree granting graduate programs (for example, certificate programs and graduate diplomas) anyone else not included in the exception list below Who doesn’t need a provincial attestation letter? primary and secondary school students master’s or doctoral degree students in-Canada visiting or exchange students studying at a designated learning institution Corrected on February 27, 2024 in-Canada study permit and work permit holders (includes study permit holders applying for an extension) in-Canada family members of study permit or work permit holders students whose application we received before 8:30 a.m. EST on January 22, 2024 2. Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) update for graduates of master’s degree programs In recognition that graduates of master’s degree granting programs are excellent candidates to succeed in Canada’s labour market and potentially transition to permanent residence, we have made a change to the length of the PGWP, so that they have the opportunity to meet the required Canadian work experience in order to apply for their permanent residence. Starting on February 15, 2024, a longer, 3-year post-graduation work permit will be available to those who are graduating from a master’s degree program that is less than 2 years and who meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. The length of PGWPs for programs other than master’s degrees will continue to align with the length of the study program, to a maximum of 3 years. Who is eligible for a longer post-graduation work permit (PGWP)? Graduates of programs that are at least two years in length at PGWP-eligible designated learning institutions are eligible for a 3-year PGWP, as are graduates of master’s degree programs less than 2 years in length. 3. PGWP eligibility for public-private partnership college programs Some provinces allow public colleges to license their curriculum to be delivered by an affiliated private college. In these cases, students physically attend a private college, but graduate with a diploma from a public institution. Concerns have been raised with regard to the quality of education provided by these institutions, as well as the lack of sufficient student supports. The Auditor General of Ontario has also raised concerns about a lack of oversight into program quality and student services at these institutions. As such, IRCC has made a change to restrict PGWPs for these institutions, anticipating that without the ability to apply for a PGWP, there will be a reduction in the number of international students enrolling in them. Who is eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? International students currently enrolled will remain eligible for a PGWP if they meet other program eligibility criteria. Who is not eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? New students enrolling in this type of program will not be eligible for a post-graduation work permit. 4. Changes to open work permit eligibility for spouses In the coming weeks, eligibility for open work permits for the spouses and common-law partners of international students will be updated. Who can get an open work permit? Eligibility is limited to the spouses and common-law partners of students in graduate (master’s and doctorate) and professional degree–granting programs only. Once these changes are in effect, spouses and common-law partners of international students seeking to extend their existing work permit will continue to be eligible under this stream. Who will not be eligible for an open work permit? The spouses and common-law partners of international students in other levels of study, including undergraduate and college programs, will no longer be eligible for an open work permit unless they already hold an open work permit under this stream.

As such, IRCC has made a change to restrict PGWPs for these institutions, anticipating that without the ability to apply for a PGWP, there will be a reduction in the number of international students enrolling in them. Who is eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? International students currently enrolled will remain eligible for a PGWP if they meet other program eligibility criteria. Who is not eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? New students enrolling in this type of program will not be eligible for a post-graduation work permit. 4. Changes to open work permit eligibility for spouses In the coming weeks, eligibility for open work permits for the spouses and common-law partners of international students will be updated. Who can get an open work permit? Eligibility is limited to the spouses and common-law partners of students in graduate (master’s and doctorate) and professional degree–granting programs only. Once these changes are in effect, spouses and common-law partners of international students seeking to extend their existing work permit will continue to be eligible under this stream. Who will not be eligible for an open work permit? The spouses and common-law partners of international students in other levels of study, including undergraduate and college programs, will no longer be eligible for an open work permit unless they already hold an open work permit under this stream.

It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders. The principal applicant must demonstrate they have the ability to become economically established. A Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) applicant may have a child who does not meet the definition of “dependent child” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), and therefore cannot be included in the application for permanent residence. If an economic development organization of a participating community decides to issue a recommendation to this dependant in their own right, this dependant will then have to submit their own application for permanent residence and will be assessed on the merits of their own ability to become economically established. Factors to examine when determining the ability to become economically established In cases where the officer is not satisfied that the issuance of a recommendation and the fulfilment of the selection criteria are sufficient indicators of an applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada, they may examine certain factors as part of the overall assessment to determine the applicant’s ability to become economically established. These factors may include current job or job offer language ability work experience education and training The weight given to these factors may vary on a case-by-case basis. For example, when an applicant has a high level of education such as a PhD and is nominated for a low-level service position, this mismatch may be acceptable if the job is an entry-level opportunity. If the same PhD applicant were nominated for a position as a welder and lacked the relevant training and work experience, there would be little alignment between their labour market intentions and their skills and abilities. An indicator of the ability to become economically established is the applicant’s intention and ability to enter the labour market in order to fully support themselves. If the officer is not satisfied that the individual intends to enter the labour market, they should consider refusing the application. Critical in determining the applicant’s ability to become economically established is the officer’s comparison of the requirements of the occupation (indicated by the National Occupation Classification (NOC) in the submitted recommendation) with all of the information provided by the applicant. The officer must examine all information provided to ensure that there is consistency throughout the elements of the application before making a final determination.

Canada is responsible for: ensuring that applicants admitted under the Provincial Nominee Program have met the requirements of membership in the economic class as provided under the IRPA, and that they are assessed for nomination using criteria designed to determine their eligibility for consideration in the economic class; making the final selection and admissibility decisions and issuing visas; and ensuring that performance monitoring and evaluation systems are in place at the federal level to ensure that the national Provincial Nominee Program continues to meet its economic objectives. 1.3.4 To process New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominees for permanent residence as expeditiously as possible, taking into account: New Brunswick’s annual Provincial Nominee Program plan; Canada’s projected annual immigration levels plan as per section 94 of the IRPA; the number of provincial nomination certificates issued in each calendar year, as referred to in section 3.4; legislative and regulatory requirements, including eligibility, admissibility and Ministerial Instructions; and operational and resource constraints. 2.0 Shared Principles 2.1 Canada and New Brunswick agree to abide by and uphold the following shared principles: 2.1.1 New Brunswick is best positioned to: determine the specific economic and labour market needs of New Brunswick vis-à-vis immigration; and assess and nominate candidates that will meet these economic and labour market needs and have the ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick. 2.1.2 Canada is responsible for national immigration policy direction, the overall design and management of the movement of Permanent and Temporary Residents to Canada and, in accordance with section 94 of the IRPA, for the establishment of an annual immigration plan containing a projection of the number of immigrants to be admitted to Canada each year in total and in each immigrant category; and, in accordance with section 87.3 of the IRPA, for the processing of applications and requests in a manner that, in the opinion of the Minister, will best support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada. In carrying out its responsibilities under sections 94 and 87.3 of the IRPA, Canada is committed to working equitably with all interested parties, including New Brunswick. 2.1.3 Canada is responsible for the creation of immigration classes within the legislation; New Brunswick is responsible for the design, promotion, recruitment, administration, monitoring, evaluation and integrity of its Provincial Nominee Program, and may create categories within this program to the extent that these categories identify individuals solely on the basis of their ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick, and are compatible with the definitions and criteria applicable to the Provincial Nominee Class under the IRPA and the IRPR and with national immigration policy. 2.1.4 Canada will process Provincial Nominee applications from applicants nominated in all provinces and territories equitably and as expeditiously as possible, within the number of nomination certificates issued each calendar year, subject to the provisions of sections 3.4 and 9.2, operational and resource constraints and balancing multiple competing priorities, including any priorities which may arise as a result of Ministerial instructions issued under section 87.3 of the IRPA. 2.1.5 Canada and New Brunswick agree on the importance of the following shared principles: the Provincial Nominee Program as a strategic tool for significant economic benefit in the region; proactively encouraging immigration to Francophone Minority Communities in New Brunswick; communication and collaboration to ensure program integrity, effective management and successful outcomes; program integrity activities in maintaining the integrity of the Provincial Nominee Program; standardized methodology for all Provincial Nominee Program evaluations to ensure that performance information common to all jurisdictions is collected and evaluated in a comparable manner; and the Provincial Nominee Program as a tool for spreading the benefits of immigration across Canada and the critical role that the settlement and retention of provincial nominees in the nominating jurisdiction plays in achieving this goal. 2.1.6 Both Parties will consult in a timely manner on proposed changes to policies, legislation, regulations and programs which could have a significant impact, fiscal or otherwise, on the operation of New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program. 3.0 Planning and Reporting 3.1 New Brunswick will develop a Provincial Nominee Program plan based on the shared principles agreed to by the parties in section 2.1. New Brunswick may submit this plan to Canada on an annual basis, in advance of consultations, for consideration in developing Canada’s projections for Canada’s immigration levels planning. In establishing its Provincial Nominee Program plan, New Brunswick will consult with Canada, taking into account Canada’s role in national immigration policy and planning. 3.2 Canada will make all reasonable efforts to incorporate New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan into Canada’s immigration plan. 3.3 In establishing the number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations allocated to New Brunswick as part of Canada’s immigration plan, Canada may consider New Brunswick’s results in achieving the expected outcomes of the Provincial Nominee Program, including but not limited to: 3.3.1 New Brunswick’s ability to identify fraud; 3.3.2 New Brunswick’s ability to identify nominees on their ability to become economically established within New Brunswick; 3.3.3 New Brunswick’s ability to retain nominees in New Brunswick; and 3.3.4 New Brunswick’s ability to address provincial labour market and economic needs through the Provincial Nominee Program. 3.4 The number of Provincial Nominee Program nominations as set by Canada in consultation with New Brunswick, subject to the principles outlined in section 2.1, may be adjusted at any time during the year upon agreement by both Parties. By September 30, or periodically as agreed to by both Parties, New Brunswick will inform Canada of its progress in issuing nomination certificates for the current calendar year. 3.5 Reporting on New Brunswick’s levels planning will be undertaken as follows: 3.5.1 New Brunswick will provide Canada with an annual report for the preceding year on New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program plan and the results achieved based on calendar year, no later than four (4) weeks after receiving the specified format from Canada; and 3.5.2 The annual report will include but is not limited to the elements outlined in Schedule A. The province will amend the annual report, as required, to ensure that it includes performance indicators listed in the Provincial Nominee Program Performance Measurement framework outlined in section 7.2. 3.6 The Parties undertake to give one another notice, in a manner that is as timely as possible, of any change in procedure, policy, regulations or legislation relating to their respective programs or operations that is likely to affect the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.0 Assessment and Nomination 4.1 New Brunswick has the sole and non-transferable responsibility to assess and nominate candidates who, in New Brunswick’s determination: 4.1.1 will be of benefit to the economic development of New Brunswick; and 4.1.2 have the ability and intention to economically establish and permanently settle in New Brunswick subject to sections 4.3 through 4.11. 4.2 Canada shall consider New Brunswick’s nomination as evidence that New Brunswick has carried out its due diligence determining that an applicant has met the requirements of New Brunswick’s Provincial Nominee Program. 4.3 In order to exercise its nomination authority under this Annex, New Brunswick will develop and use objective and transparent criteria for nomination which will assess the ability and intention of the applicant to become economically established in New Brunswick and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the Province. New Brunswick will codify and publish Provincial Nominee Program requirements, policy and procedures in publicly available directives. Applicants will be required to meet these criteria in order to be nominated. New Brunswick will respect the principles and objectives of this Annex in developing and implementing its criteria and procedures. 4.4 New Brunswick will provide Canada, in confidence, all necessary information regarding the criteria, policies and procedures that it has established for the categories under its Provincial Nominee Program, as outlined in stream design templates provided by Canada, prior to the introduction or modification of any Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project. Canada will conduct a review of any proposed changes and, if it has determined that the changes are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national immigration policies, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to the proposed changes. To the extent possible, the timing and duration of the review will be mutually agreed upon by Canada and New Brunswick prior to the start of the review process, taking into account resource constraints. While Canada will strive to undertake the review as expeditiously as possible, the period of this review will vary according to the complexity of the proposed changes. New Brunswick will only implement the new or amended Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project once Canada and New Brunswick have reached agreement. 4.5 Provincial Nominee applicants will be nominated solely on the basis of economic benefit to New Brunswick and their ability and intention of becoming economically established and permanently residing in New Brunswick. Economic establishment will be determined on the basis of factors such as: current job or job offer, language ability, work experience meeting critical skills shortages, education and training, and business ownership skills and past experience. 4.6 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, shall not constitute an eligibility condition. 4.7 Non-economic factors, including but not limited to family connections or community ties, may be considered as part of the assessment of the applicant's adaptability and intentions to reside in the nominating province. However, they shall not constitute a determining factor under any stream or category under the Provincial Nominee Program. 4.8 New Brunswick agrees to maintain the minimum language standards and mandatory testing implemented on July 1, 2012 for Provincial Nominees at Skill Level C and D of the National Occupational Classification 2016, or Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) category 4 and 5 of the National Occupational Classification 2021, and to work towards establishing minimum language standards and/or mandatory testing for all other Provincial Nominees. 4.8.1 For those streams, categories or occupations subject to minimum language standards and mandatory testing, New Brunswick will confirm that nominations are based on valid language test results. New Brunswick will require those applicants to have their proficiency assessed in the English or French language by an organization or institution designated by Canada and these applicants must have obtained proficiencies for their abilities to speak, listen, read and write that correspond to agreed upon benchmarks. Only language test results from an organization or institution designated by Canada and the correlation of those results with the agreed upon benchmarks will be accepted as evidence of the applicant’s proficiency in an official language for the purposes of this provision. The official notification of the results issued by the designated organization or a copy must be included with the application for permanent residence. The benchmarks are as follows: In the case of an applicant who has a job offer for an occupation listed in Skill Level C and D, or TEER category 4 or 5 of the National Occupational Classification, or has acquired work experience in one or more occupations that are listed in Skill Level C and D, or TEER category 4 or 5 of the National Occupational Classification matrix, applicants must have obtained proficiencies that correspond to the Canadian Language Benchmark of 4 or higher in each of the following competencies: speaking, listening, reading and writing. A time-limited exemption of this requirement for New Brunswick’s Critical Worker Pilot is authorized under Schedule B. 4.8.2 As applicants in other streams, categories or occupations become subject to minimum language standards and mandatory testing, New Brunswick will follow the same process as outlined in section 4.8.1 to ensure that these applicants have obtained proficiencies for their abilities to speak, listen, read and write that correspond to agreed upon benchmarks. 4.8.3 Applications for permanent residence which require the submission of language test results as per 4.8.1(a) and which do not include valid language test results or the language results do not meet the above requirements will be returned to the applicant. 4.9 In exercising its nomination authority under this Annex, New Brunswick will apply the criteria for nomination referred to in sections 4.1 through 4.8 and follow the policy and procedures established by New Brunswick, as amended from time to time, insofar as these criteria, policy and procedures are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR or any successor legislation and regulations, national immigration policies and the terms of the Agreement and this Annex. These criteria will be applied to all individuals applying under the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and New Brunswick does not have the authority to waive these criteria. 4.10 New Brunswick will not issue a nomination certificate to: 4.10.1 any person whose employment is likely to affect the settlement of any labour dispute or affect the employment of a person involved in such a dispute, or whose employment will adversely affect employment or training opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents in New Brunswick; 4.10.2 any person who intends to enter, has agreed to enter, or has entered into an “immigration-linked investment scheme” as described in section 87 of the IRPR, or its successor; 4.10.3 any person who New Brunswick does not determine will be of benefit to the economic development of New Brunswick; or 4.10.4 any person who does not have the ability and intention to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick. 4.11 New Brunswick will make every reasonable effort to ensure the collection and verification of all documentation supporting a nomination is genuine, and will conduct due diligence as and when warranted to confirm the authenticity of documents supporting a nomination and the veracity of information provided. 4.12 New Brunswick will keep written or electronic records of its assessments of its nominees against those criteria for a minimum of six years from the date of nomination and share those records with Canada if requested to do so, subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement. 4.13 New Brunswick is responsible for ascertaining an applicant’s ability to economically establish and settle in New Brunswick, and will conduct due diligence to ensure the applicant’s ability to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Canada retains the right to request additional documentation from the nominee which supports the nominee’s ability and intention to become economically established and settle in New Brunswick and to substitute its evaluation of the applicant’s ability and intention to become economically established in Canada pursuant to subsection 87(3) of the IRPR. In exercising its responsibilities under sections 4.2 and 4.19 and sections 6.1 to 6.7, Canada may also seek clarification and request documentation from New Brunswick on its assessment, the record of which is required under section 4.11 and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. 4.14 New Brunswick will issue a dated nomination certificate, valid in accordance with New Brunswick’s administrative requirements, for each Provincial Nominee. The nomination certificate initial validity will not exceed six months. The nomination certificate will specify information including, but not limited to, the category under which the nomination has been made, as well as other information outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. For security reasons, New Brunswick will forward a record of the Confirmation of Nomination, by electronic means, to the location specified by Canada. A Confirmation of Nomination received directly from the candidate or other Parties will not be accepted as evidence of the nomination. Nominees must file an application for permanent residency within the time limit specified on the Confirmation of Nomination. 4.15 New Brunswick will not issue nomination certificates in excess of the annual amount established by Canada in section 3.4. 4.16 In accordance with section 12.5.3 of the Agreement, on a five-year schedule, New Brunswick will conduct an independent and objective audit of the activities required to implement sections 4.1 to 4.15 and 5.2 to 5.4 to assess whether the procedures which have been established and documented are respected and that adequate oversight mechanisms have been put in place for ongoing program monitoring and reporting, subject to the following conditions: 4.16.1 Audits will be consistent with the standards established by the Institute of Internal Auditors; 4.16.2 New Brunswick will consult with Canada on the terms of reference for the audit; 4.16.3 New Brunswick will provide the results of audits, including the management responses and associated action plans, to Canada; 4.16.4 New Brunswick will report to Canada on the status of the action plan agreed to by the province on an annual basis until the completion of all action items. Canada will not disclose the results of audits, including the management responses, without the consent of New Brunswick; 4.16.5 Following the audit as described in 4.16, New Brunswick or Canada may request a review of the Provincial Nominee Program streams currently in place. Should a review be requested by either party, New Brunswick agrees to provide Canada with information on the stream design, as required. Canada and New Brunswick will cooperate on an assessment of the stream following the processes identified in section 4.4 and, if it is determined that the streams are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national and provincial immigration policies and objectives, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to proceed without changes; and 4.16.6 New Brunswick shall undertake the audit as described in section 4.16 within one (1) year of the Agreement taking effect, unless such an activity was completed within the previous three (3) years. 4.17 Subject to sections 3.4 and 9.2, Canada agrees to process applicants nominated for Permanent Resident status by New Brunswick as expeditiously as possible with a view to achieving targets that have been integrated into Canada’s immigration levels plan, and to balancing multiple competing priorities, including those reflected in Ministerial Instructions issued under section 87.3 of the IRPA. 4.18 Canada will communicate the terms of this Annex to offices involved in the processing of Provincial Nominee Program cases to ensure consistent application of all principles agreed upon at processing offices. 4.19 Upon receipt of the application for permanent residence, together with the Confirmation of Nomination from New Brunswick, Canada will: 4.19.1 determine the eligibility of the nominee as a member of the Provincial Nominee Class pursuant to section 87 of the IRPR; 4.19.2 determine the admissibility of the nominee and the nominee’s family members with respect to legislative requirements; and 4.19.3 issue permanent resident visas to Provincial Nominees and accompanying family members who meet all the requirements of the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and the eligibility and admissibility requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR. 4.20 Should Canada determine that an individual nominated by New Brunswick is likely to be refused a permanent resident visa based on the requirements of membership in the Provincial Nominee Class as per the IRPR and this Annex, New Brunswick will be notified as soon as possible, taking into consideration local operating environments, and New Brunswick will be consulted regarding the reasons for possible refusal. 4.21 New Brunswick may raise concerns or seek clarification from the assessing office with respect to a potential refusal, where the refusal is based on a finding that the applicant does not satisfy the requirements for membership in the Provincial Nominee Class in accordance with the provisions of the IRPR, within sixty (60) days from the date of being advised by Canada. 4.22 In all cases where Canada determines that an individual nominated by New Brunswick does not meet the admissibility requirements of the IRPA, Canada will refuse without notifying New Brunswick before the final decision. Subject to privacy laws and to the extent consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick, Canada will forward a copy of the refusal letter to New Brunswick in a timely fashion. 4.23 Canada and New Brunswick are committed to working together to assure program integrity. Accordingly, where Canada has refused an applicant on the basis of misrepresentation under section 40 of the IRPA, Canada will share case-specific information as described in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing Between Canada and New Brunswick. New Brunswick shall conduct a review of the relevant provincial application, in accordance with its policies and procedures. 5.0 Admission 5.1 New Brunswick may support the application for a work permit in the following instances: 5.1.1 where a nominee is employed or has a job offer and is urgently required by the employer; or 5.1.2 where a potential business nominee is required to enter Canada as a Temporary Resident in order to meet the requirements of the New Brunswick business stream. 5.2 For nominees specified under 5.1.1, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of employment: 5.2.1 the job offer is genuine, and not part-time or seasonal; 5.2.2 the individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.2.3 the individual is reasonably able to carry out the functions of the job offer; and 5.2.4 the employer is not in violation of the IRPA/IRPR, as notified by Canada, and/or New Brunswick employment standards, as notified by the provincial employment standards body. 5.3 For nominees specified under 5.1.1, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of a job offer: 5.3.1 the job offer is genuine, and not part-time or seasonal; 5.3.2 the individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.3.3 the individual is reasonably able to carry out the functions of the job offer; 5.3.4 that Canadians and Permanent Residents had been considered first to fill the job; and 5.3.5 the employer is not in violation of the IRPA/IRPR, as notified by Canada, and/or provincial employment standards, as notified by the provincial employment standards body. 5.4 For candidates specified under 5.1.2, New Brunswick is responsible for conducting due diligence to verify that, in the case of a potential business nominee: 5.4.1 the proposed business is consistent with New Brunswick’s requirements, and that the business plan is economically plausible; 5.4.2 the applicant will actively engage in establishing the proposed business; 5.4.3 the applicant is reasonably able to carry out the functions of business ownership/management; and 5.4.4 in the case where an applicant is entering Canada on a work permit in order to establish a business and meet the requirements of nominations, that the applicant is likely to meet the requirements for nomination within the initial period authorized. 5.5 New Brunswick will keep written or electronic records of its assessments of due diligence described in sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 for a minimum of six years from the date of the issuance of a letter of support and will share those records with Canada if requested to do so, subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement. 5.6 In the case of a nominee with employment or a job offer, where New Brunswick has conducted the due diligence as described in section 5.2 or 5.3, and determined that entry of a foreign national under a work permit is of significant benefit to New Brunswick, the New Brunswick may support an application for a work permit pursuant to paragraph 204(c) of the IRPR with a letter indicating that: 5.6.1 the nominated individual is urgently required by the employer; 5.6.2 the job offer or employment is genuine and will create economic benefits or opportunities; 5.6.3 the employment is not part-time or seasonal; 5.6.4 the wages and working conditions of the employment would be sufficient to attract and retain Canadian citizens or permanent residents, as per New Brunswick prevailing wage rates; and 5.6.5 New Brunswick is requesting that Canada issue a work permit for a specific period to cover the duration of processing of the permanent resident application, which Canada will take into account when issuing a work permit. 5.7 Recognizing the administrative resources required by New Brunswick to issue letters in support of work permit applications under IRPR 204(c), Canada and New Brunswick agree to work towards streamlining the process for admission as a Temporary Resident. Should Canada, New Brunswick, and the other Canadian provinces and territories, agree to a new process for supporting admission of Temporary Residents, the new process will terminate and replace the process outlined under section 5 of this Annex. Canada further agrees to process Temporary Resident applications of applicants nominated for Permanent Resident status by New Brunswick, as expeditiously as possible and subject to operational and resource constraints and balancing multiple competing priorities, with a view to addressing urgent needs of employers. 5.8 Where New Brunswick is considering an application for nomination under the business category of the Provincial Nominee Program, has conducted due diligence as described in section 5.4, and has determined that entry of a foreign national under a work permit to carry out business activity is of significant benefit to New Brunswick, New Brunswick may support an application for a work permit pursuant to paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR with a letter indicating that: 5.8.1 the foreign national is being considered for nomination for permanent residence based on their assessed business plan to conduct business activity in the province; 5.8.2 New Brunswick has determined that the planned business activity will be of significant benefit to the province; and 5.8.3 New Brunswick is requesting that Canada issue a work permit for a specific period, up to a maximum of two (2) years, which Canada will take into account when issuing a work permit. 5.9 Where New Brunswick has provided a letter of support as described in section 5.8, New Brunswick acknowledges that Canada will complete an assessment of the foreign national’s work permit application against paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR. Canada will consider New Brunswick’s letter of support as evidence of New Brunswick’s assessment of economic benefit in making its own determination that the intended work would create or maintain significant social, cultural or economic benefits or opportunities for Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents. 5.10 Upon receipt of the application for a work permit under paragraph 204(c) of the IRPR, Canada will: 5.10.1 determine the eligibility of the applicant for a work permit pursuant to section 200 of the IRPR; 5.10.2 determine the admissibility of the applicant with respect to legislative requirements; and 5.10.3 issue a work permit to applicants who: meet all the requirements of the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program and the eligibility and admissibility requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR, and have submitted with their work permit application a letter of support from New Brunswick as described in section 5.6. 5.11 Where a temporary work permit issued under section 5.10 of this Annex is due to expire and New Brunswick has nominated that foreign national and the foreign national has applied for permanent residence and has been found eligible, Canada may issue a work permit to that foreign national pursuant to paragraph 205(a) of the IRPR. 6.0 Program Integrity 6.1 Canada and New Brunswick have shared responsibility for program integrity in the administration of the Provincial Nominee Program. To ensure the integrity of the program, both Canada and New Brunswick will conduct both quality of decision-making and anti-fraud exercises on a periodic basis and will implement changes to the program as necessary in a timely manner. 6.2 Subject to section 12.4 of the Agreement, Canada and New Brunswick will cooperate to ensure the integrity of the Provincial Nominee Program, including, but not limited to, activities such as: 6.2.1 investigating potential program abuses to ensure the rigour and confidence of the immigration system; 6.2.2 sharing information including personal information and intelligence related to program abuses, subject to privacy laws and to the extent required by the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Information Sharing between Canada and New Brunswick; 6.2.3 working collaboratively with other federal agencies, as required, to address issues related to admissibility, including anti-fraud activities, criminality and public safety; 6.2.4 coordinating and streamlining investigations involving both jurisdictions; and 6.2.5 conducting and disseminating research, and identifying knowledge gaps related to program integrity and quality assurance mechanisms. 6.3 Canada and New Brunswick will continuously seek to improve program integrity by acting upon knowledge gained through periodic program integrity and quality assurance activities, with an emphasis on: 6.3.1 identifying and evaluating risk inform","3":"0","4":"upload","index":1},{"0":"2023-06-28 00:00:00","1":"Bridging open work permits for certain economic class permanent residence applicants [R205(a) - A75] – International Mobility Program","2":"Bridging open work permits for certain economic class permanent residence applicants [R205(a) - A75] – International Mobility Program This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff.

This applies to the following classes: FSWC CEC FSTC PNP (where the applicant is accepted through the provincial or territorial Express Entry stream) APR under the QSWC has passed the section R10 completeness check receipt of a positive eligibility assessment on their non-Express Entry APR submitted by mail or online under one of the following classes or pilots: caring for children caring for people with high medical needs AFP PNP (where the applicant does not qualify for Express Entry) HCCPP or HSWP after completing their qualifying work experience Note: For specific eligibility criteria regarding PNP, AFP and QSWC applicants, please see Specific eligibility – Provincial nominees Specific eligibility – Agri-Food Pilot Specific eligibility – Quebec skilled workers Specific eligibility - Home Child Care Provider Pilot (HCCPP) or Home Support Worker Pilot (HSWP) The department uses specific administrative codes to identify certain situations where it considers the work of a foreign national to create significant social, cultural or economic benefits or opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents, as described in R205(a). The factors provided for each code demonstrate how the situation may meet the requirements of R205(a). Officers must also always be satisfied that all requirements of R200 are met. The administrative code A75 is the code under which the work of certain foreign nationals, who are already working in Canada and are able to maintain their employment and settle while transitioning to permanent residence, may create significant economic or social benefits. As such, the following foreign nationals do not qualify for a BOWP: foreign nationals in Canada under section R186 who are exempt from the work permit requirement, except those under paragraph R186(u). This cohort is not transitioning from a work permit to permanent residence. foreign nationals applying for a BOWP at a port of entry or visa office (as they have not yet been authorized to enter as a temporary resident under section A22). There is a significant benefit to applicants being physically in Canada and working while transitioning to permanent residence. spouses and dependants of principal permanent residence applicants. This cohort of foreign nationals has access to work permits under different LMIA exemption categories. foreign nationals who are inadmissible to Canada Documentary evidence Applicants for a BOWP must provide the following: a completed Application to Change Conditions, Extend my Stay or Remain in Canada as a Worker form [IMM 5710 (PDF, 442 KB)] The response to “What type of work permit are you applying for?” must be “Open Work Permit” to meet the eligibility requirements. payment of the work permit processing fee, the open work permit holder fee and, if applicable, the restoration fee proof that they have met the APR stage corresponding to their permanent residence class and application submission, as stated in the General eligibility section Applicants under the AFP, the caring for children class and the caring for people with high medical needs class are issued an approval in principle letter or eligibility letter upon receiving a positive eligibility assessment on their APR and must provide a copy of this letter with their open work permit application. Specific eligibility – Provincial nominees Foreign nationals in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) are eligible for a BOWP only if they provided with their application a copy of the nomination letter issued by the nominating province or territory that indicates their employment is unrestricted selected “Open Work Permit” on their application form For certain employer-driven streams in the PNP, the nominating province or territory may impose employment restrictions on a successful nominee until the person becomes a permanent resident. If employment restrictions are imposed, IRCC does not issue an open work permit to the foreign national under the BOWP LMIA exemption. For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory (LMIA exemption code T13). To help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP. Template letter Provinces and territories may include an employer or the name of the occupation and the National Occupational Classification (NOC) code and still indicate that there are no employment restrictions. In these cases, applicants are eligible for an open work permit, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria. A separate letter from the applicant or the nominating province to confirm that no employment restrictions exist should not be requested. Employment location (mandatory imposition of condition) When a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the PNP, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the nominating province. See Specific conditions related to temporary work Therefore, in the Global Case Management System (GCMS), the “Province of Destination” must be the nominating province. The “City of Destination” is the name of the province followed by “NES” (not elsewhere stated) to allow for work anywhere in the nominating province. For example: Province of Destination: AB City of Destination: Alberta NES Specific eligibility – Agri-Food Pilot BOWP applications for the Agri-Food Pilot (AFP) must be submitted online. Applicants must provide their approval in principle letter in the “Client Information” field with their online work permit application. Specific eligibility – Quebec skilled workers Under the terms of the Canada–Quebec Accord, Quebec is responsible for selecting applicants destined for the province of Quebec, and IRCC is responsible for determining admissibility. Those selected by the province are issued a Certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ). Applicants in the Quebec skilled workers class are eligible for a BOWP after a completeness check (R10). The CSQ must have been valid when the APR was submitted. Employment location When a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the QSWC, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the province of Quebec. See: Specific conditions related to temporary work Therefore, in the GCMS, the “Province of Destination” must be “QC,” and the “City of Destination” must be entered as Quebec NES (not elsewhere stated), as in the following example: Province of Destination: QC City of Destination: Quebec NES Work permit validity for QSWC QSWC processing times usually extend to 24 months or more. Therefore, to ensure that applicants do not have to submit multiple work permit extensions, the duration for the initial BOWP is 24 months or passport validity, whichever is shorter. Extensions, if needed, should be issued for 12 months. However, on a case-by-case basis, officers may use their discretion, depending on current processing times for QSWC permanent residence applications. Specific eligibility – Home Child Care Provider Pilot (HCCPP) or Home Support Worker Pilot (HSWP) Foreign nationals in the HCCPP or HSWP are eligible for a BOWP if they have received a positive eligibility decision (approval in principle) on their application for permanent residence after completing their qualifying work experience. Under the ministerial instructions dated June 18, 2019, applicants in the HCCPP or the HSWP had to complete 24 months of qualifying work experience. On April 30, 2023, the 24 months of experience was reduced to 12 months of qualifying experience. This change applies to all applications, including pending applications. The application should be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt from the requirement to submit an in-Canada application online under R9.4 or R9.5. How pilot applicants provide proof of their work experience depends on their category: Gaining experience category (Category A): Applicants complete 12 months of qualifying experience after being approved for an occupation-restricted work permit, then submit Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 2.26 MB) with evidence of qualifying work experience. Direct to permanent residence category (Category B): Applicants submit Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 2.26 MB) and evidence of work experience with their application for permanent residence. Important: In the case where a Category A applicant obtains the qualifying work experience before being issued a work permit under this administrative code, after passing eligibility on the PR application, assess the work permit under the Bridging open work permit guidance. The following special program code should be used: CARE4411 (Caregivers – HCCP Pilot) CARE4412 (Caregivers – HSW Pilot) Application assessment Work permit applications are processed based on the information provided by the foreign national. If the foreign national has indicated on their work permit application that they are applying for an open work permit, officers must ensure that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements, regardless of whether an employer’s name is mentioned in the application. If it is clear that complex or contentious issues or concerns exist on the APR (for example, the APR is approved in principle, but further investigation on the client is required), the work permit application should be referred to a local office for additional review. Once satisfied that any complex or contentious issues have been resolved, the local office can issue the work permit following these same instructions. Important: Officers should ensure that both general and specific eligibility are met. Permanent residence application stage Express Entry or QSWC: Completeness check If a foreign national submits an e-APR using Express Entry or submits an application under the QSWC, they may apply for an open work permit using this administrative LMIA exemption code once they meet the General eligibility criteria. A BOWP can only be issued if the e-APR or QSWC application has passed the section R10 completeness check. As such, Express Entry applicants or QSWC applicants should submit their acknowledgement of receipt with their BOWP application. Before issuing a BOWP, officers must check the GCMS to ensure that the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) has reviewed the application and determined that it meets the requirements of a complete application as described in sections R10 and R12.01. If the e-APR or QSWC APR is incomplete, the application for a BOWP must be refused. The open work permit holder fee should be refunded, but the processing fee can't be. Complete application: The CIO enters the following case note in GCMS: “R10 OK.” Incomplete application: The CIO cancels the e-APR and enter the following note in GCMS: “E-APR rejected as incomplete. Client not eligible for BOWP.” Non-Express Entry APR: Determining if a positive eligibility decision has been made If the paper APR under one of the qualifying economic classes was submitted outside Express Entry (except for applications under the QSWC), there must have been a positive eligibility assessment for the foreign national to be eligible for a BOWP. The positive eligibility assessment is considered to be made once the status of the “Eligibility” field in the GCMS is set to one of the following: For application received on or after January 1, 2015: “Passed” For applications received before January 1, 2015: “Met” See further requirements above under Specific eligibility – Provincial nominees and Specific Eligibility – Agri-Food Pilot. Applicants applying for a BOWP must include evidence that confirms they have met eligibility with their open work permit application. Renewals Subsequent requests from applicants to extend their stay on an unrestricted open work permit should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Final decision Approval On the Application screen, officers should confirm or enter the following information in the specified fields: Field Selection or Input Case Type 27 Under examination Exemption Code A75 Province of Destination For provincial nominees and QSWC only: employment must be limited to the province or territory of nomination City of Destination For provincial nominees and QSWC only: [Name of province] NES (not elsewhere stated) For example, Alberta NES, Quebec NES NOC 99999 Intended Occupation Open Employer Open Valid to 24 months from date of issue Conditions – Medical If no medical examination was completed, see Medical conditions to be imposed for open employer but occupation-restricted work permits Conditions - Location For PNP and QSWC applications, the following location condition must be imposed: Not authorized to work in any location other than stated. User Remark (mandatory) APR Pending For HCCPP or HSWP: Pending APR stage-2 approval / Caregiver pilot Important: In HCCPP or HSWP applications, the officer must input the User remark on the work permit. This remark, in addition to the case type code, ensures eligibility for continued health care coverage by the province or territory. Refusals If an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, they should record their reasons for the decision as per the instructions in: Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision. Family members Under the authority of subparagraph 205(c)(ii) of the IRPR, genuine accompanying spouses, common-law partners and dependant children are eligible for an open work permit under the administrative code C49 if the principal foreign national was issued a bridging open work permit under the administrative code A75.

This creates a challenge for those who came to Canada as a minor but did not obtain permanent residence or citizenship and are now ineligible, including those who later committed crimes in Canada. Not all individuals who came to Canada as a minor obtained permanent residence or citizenship. Others have since lost their permanent resident status due to being inadmissible. Some of these individuals were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider under a provincial or territorial government’s designated ministry for child protection by court order as a minor in Canada. In some cases, permanent resident status or citizenship were not sought for these individuals when they were eligible and while under the legal responsibility of a child protection agency and, as a result, some individuals who are now inadmissible are facing deportation and an uncertain future. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the vulnerability of these individuals, and the particular risk they may face if deported to their country of nationality; a country with which they have little or no connection and of which they, often, do not speak the language as a result of living in Canada for many years. Public Policy Considerations In recognition of the vulnerability of certain individuals who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider, and may now face removal, this public policy will provide a pathway to permanent residence to eligible foreign nationals and their in-Canada family members. For some of these individuals, applications for permanent residence and/or citizenship where not made on their behalf while in the care of a child protection agency. As such, I hereby establish, pursuant to my authority under section 25.2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act), that there are public policy considerations that justify the granting of permanent residence to in-Canada principal applicants and their in-Canada family members, if these foreign nationals meet the applicable conditions (eligibility requirements) listed below. Part 1 – Conditions (eligibility requirements) applicable to principal applicants Based on public policy considerations, delegated officers may grant permanent residence status to foreign nationals who meet the following conditions: Foreign national who: entered Canada before age 19; is physically in Canada at time of application under this public policy; has continuously resided in Canada for at least three years on the date of their application; has continuously resided in Canada since age 19, if over the age of 19; was under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider under a provincial or territorial government’s designated ministry for child protection for at least 1 year (cumulative); intends to reside in a province or territory other than the province of Quebec; is not inadmissible other than pursuant to any of the following: subsection 36(1) of the Act on serious criminality grounds; subsection 36(2) of the Act on criminality grounds; paragraph 38(1)(c) of the Act on health grounds for a health condition that might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services; section 39 of the Act on financial reasons; paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Act for no other reasons than misrepresentation related to their entry to Canada or overstaying their temporary resident status and working or studying without authorization; paragraph 40(1)(b) of the Act for being or having been sponsored by a person who is determined to be inadmissible for misrepresentation subsection 41(a) of the Act for non-compliance; section 42 of the Act where the family member is inadmissible, except where the family member is inadmissible under subsections 34(1), 35(1) or 37(1) of the Act; is not a person referred to in section F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention; holds a document enumerated at subsection 50(1) of the Regulations or if they are unable to obtain a document enumerated at subsection 50(1), provides a document described in subsection 178(1) and 178(2) of the Regulations; and is physically in Canada at time of granting of permanent residence. Part 2 – Conditions (eligibility requirements) applicable to family members in Canada In-Canada family members of a principal applicant who applies for permanent residence under this public policy are eligible to be granted permanent residence pursuant to this public policy if they meet the following conditions: the foreign national is physically present in Canada at the time of application for permanent residence under this public policy; the foreign national has been included as an accompanying family member in an application for permanent residence by a principal applicant under this public policy; the foreign national meets the definition of a “family member” in subsection 1(3) of the Regulations; the foreign national intends to reside in a province or territory other than the province of Quebec; the foreign national is not inadmissible other than pursuant to any of the following: paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Act for no other reasons than misrepresentation related to overstaying their temporary resident status and working or studying without authorization; subsection 41(a) of the Act for no other reasons than overstaying their temporary resident status and working or studying without authorization; section 42 of the Act where the family member is inadmissible, except where the family member is inadmissible under subsections 34(1), 35(1) or 37(1) of the Act; a delegated officer has determined that the principal applicant meets all conditions (eligibility requirements) pursuant to this public policy; the foreign national holds a document enumerated at subsection 50(1) of the Regulations or if they are unable to obtain a document enumerated at subsection 50(1), provides a document described in subsection 178(1) and 178(2) of the Regulations; and the foreign national is physically in Canada at time of granting of permanent residence. Definitions applicable for the purpose of this public policy For the purposes of this Public Policy, \"under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider\" refers only to situations where the responsible provincial or territorial authorities obtained full legal ‘parental’ responsibilities for the child by court order. Approval in principle Once a delegated officer assesses that the foreign national meets conditions 1 to 9 in Part 1 or 1 to 7 in Part 2 above, the delegated officer will approve the application in principle under this public policy. For greater certainty, those with known inadmissibilities, other than those listed above in Part 1, section 7, or Part 2, section 5, will not receive approval in principle. A final assessment of admissibility will be conducted prior to granting of permanent residence and the principal applicant and the family members included in their application under this public policy must not be inadmissible on any grounds other than those listed in Part 1, section 8, and Part 2, section 5, to be eligible to receive permanent residence pursuant to this public policy. Effective Date and Expiration This public policy replaces the Temporary public policy to grant permanent residence to certain individuals in Canada who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were under the legal responsibility of the child protection system signed on July 25, 2023. It takes effect on January 22, 2024 and expires on January 21, 2027. This temporary public policy may be revoked at any time. All applications received prior to the expiry or revocation of this public policy will be processed under the public policy. The Hon.

With this Levels Plan, the Government of Canada is maintaining its target of 485,000 permanent residents for 2024 and completing the final step to reach 500,000 in 2025. Starting in 2026, the government will stabilize permanent resident levels at 500,000, allowing time for successful integration, while continuing to augment Canada’s labour market. The government also plans to take action over the next year to recalibrate the number of temporary resident admissions to ensure this aspect of our immigration system also remains sustainable. The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with the provinces and territories, employers, stakeholders and Indigenous peoples to help Canada adapt to the realities of immigration-driven population growth. This approach is also guided by An Immigration System for Canada’s Future—a report that lays out a pathway to strengthen our immigration system for newcomers, businesses, and communities. Together, these measures will continue to put people at the heart of our immigration policy and ensure that newcomers have the resources they need, including settlement support and access to housing, to succeed in their new lives. Highlights of the 2024-2026 Immigration Levels Plan include: A continued long-term focus on economic growth, with over 60% of permanent resident admissions dedicated to the economic class by 2025. A commitment to uphold the Government of Canada’s humanitarian tradition support effort by responding to humanitarian and geopolitical crises around the world. New ambitious Francophone immigration targets to support Francophone communities outside of Quebec. The targets represent 6% of total immigration in 2024, 7% in 2025, and 8% in 2026. This is to strengthen Francophone communities outside of Quebec and ensure the economic prosperity of Francophone minority communities across Canada. The new Levels Plan also considers important progress IRCC has made in the past year through new digital systems and improved client service, which have increased processing capacity and reduced application backlogs. Through immigration, Canada will continue to help families stay together, bring the skills and talent we need to help companies grow their businesses, and maintain our humanitarian tradition, so that the country continues to benefit from the strength and diversity that newcomers bring to our communities. Quotes “Today’s Immigration Levels Plan for 2024-2026, sets out our targets for immigration over the next three years. By stabilizing the number of newcomers, we recognize that housing, infrastructure planning, and sustainable population growth need to be properly taken into account. Through this plan, we are striking the appropriate balance to grow Canada’s economy, while maintaining our humanitarian tradition, supporting Francophone immigration, and developing a more collaborative approach to levels planning with our partners. Canada will continue to welcome newcomers and ensure that they are supported in their new lives.” – The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Quick facts The Levels Plan is a projection of how many permanent residents will be admitted to Canada in a given year and sets targets for overall admissions per immigration category. Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Minister must table the Levels Plan in Parliament each year. The Levels Plan identifies permanent resident targets in four categories: economic immigration, family reunification, refugees and protected persons, and the humanitarian and compassionate class. IRCC is supporting employers through measures like category-based selection. As part of this initiative, IRCC is increasing the number of invitations to individuals with work experience in health care, STEM, transport, agriculture and agri-food, trades and French proficiency. On August 3, 2023, 1,500 invitations were sent to individuals with experience in the skilled trades (including carpenters, contractors, plumbers, etc.). Over the last five years, close to 38,000 tradespersons have obtained permanent residency in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class, the Provincial Nominee Program, and the Federal Skilled Trades program. Bringing in immigrants to fill labour market gaps will help Canada deliver on its National Housing Strategy, an ambitious 10-year plan that will invest more than $82 billion to give more Canadians a place to call home. Progress on programs and initiatives under this strategy is updated quarterly at www.placetocallhome.ca. Canada continues to be a global leader in refugee resettlement and labour mobility. Last year, Canada resettled more than 46,500 refugees from over 80 countries. In fact, in October 2023, Canada met its commitment to welcome at least 40,000 vulnerable Afghans. Ours is one of the largest Afghan resettlement programs in the world, and our work continues. The Levels Plan takes into account extensive engagement with provincial and territorial representatives, as well as public opinion research and consultations with various stakeholders, including businesses, community organizations, and educational institutions. The 2024 target of 485,000 new immigrants to Canada amounts to 1.2% of Canada’s current population. Canadians across the country can see how newcomers are benefiting local communities through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s Immigration Matters campaign. Under the Canada-Quebec Accord, Quebec establishes its own immigration levels.

January 16, 2024, Caraquet, New Brunswick—Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in Canada’s economic growth and promotes the vitality of Francophone minority communities and meet labour needs across the country. Today, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced in Caraquet, New Brunswick, a series of initiatives to support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. These measures include a new Francophone immigration policy, the renewal and expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, a new program to support Francophone immigration, and the implementation of the Action Plan for Official Languages—and they will all strengthen the presence of French in Canada. Francophone immigration policy The new policy promotes the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities. It paves the way for tangible, ambitious and innovative actions in the short, medium and long term that will enable progress towards restoring and increasing the demographic weight of these communities. It is also based on a series of measures such as promotion and recruitment support efforts, both in Canada and abroad, particularly for specific lines of business, in order to address labour shortages. The policy will also oversee the development of a new program and new measures dedicated to Francophone economic immigration. Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative Through the renewal of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, 14 Canadian communities will continue to receive funding to foster the integration of French-speaking newcomers. The initiative’s expansion will enable the Government of Canada to select up to 10 additional communities that will, in turn, be able to create environments that support the economic and socio-cultural integration of French-speaking newcomers. Francophone Immigration Support Program The new Francophone Immigration Support Program will fund innovative projects to eliminate barriers to Francophone immigration. This will make it easier for Francophone minority communities to participate in international promotion initiatives and support and recruit French-speaking candidates. The Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028 These initiatives are supported by an investment of over $137 million announced as part of the Government of Canada’s Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028. The implementation of all the measures in the action plan demonstrates the federal government’s firm commitment to the vitality of Francophone minority communities. The Minister also highlighted that the target of 4.4.% French-speaking resident admissions outside Quebec was surpassed in December 2023, reaching approximately 4.7% from January to December 2023, according to the currently available statistical data. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will be able to confirm the complete 2023 statistics by February 2024. Last November, IRCC announced ambitious, realistic and achievable targets for the next three years. The targets for Francophone immigrant admissions outside Quebec are 6% in 2024, 7% in 2025 and 8% in 2026. These measures will facilitate the strengthening, long-term growth and vitality of Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories, as well as key stakeholders, to strengthen these communities. Quotes “Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in strengthening our national identity. The numerous measures we are implementing will attract skilled Francophone workers who will support the economic and cultural development of these communities. Our efforts to ensure the successful reception and integration of French-speaking newcomers support our unwavering commitment to restoring and increasing the demographic weight of Francophone minority communities.” - The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship “The measures announced today aimed at promoting Francophone immigration are fundamental for the future and sustainability of Francophone communities in minority situations across the country. With the modernized Official Languages Act and the Action Plan 2023–2028, which has been in effect since this autumn, our government is implementing the necessary mechanisms and investments to achieve targets that are both ambitious and essential.” - The Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages Quick facts In April 2023, the Government of Canada announced the Action Plan for Official Languages 2023–2028: Protection-Promotion-Collaboration. The Government is committed to implementing the measures proposed in Pillar 1: Francophone Immigration: Towards the Re-establishment of the Demographic Weight of Francophones. Under the modernized Official Languages Act, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship is obligated to adopt a policy on Francophone immigration that includes objectives, targets, and indicators. In 2023, more than 19,600 French-speaking immigrants settled in Francophone communities outside Quebec. In November 2023, the Government of Canada announced nearly $85,000 in financial assistance for the Université de l’Ontario français. This investment supports the implementation of the Observatoire en immigration Francophone au Canada and contributes to Canada’s efforts to promote the reception and integration of Francophone immigrants.

International students make important contributions to Canada’s campuses, communities and economy; however, we have seen unsustainable growth in the International Student Program in recent years. These recently announced reforms will support sustainable population growth in Canada and improve system integrity, while helping to ensure that international students have a positive experience in Canada. 1. Cap and provincial attestation letter As of 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024, most new post-secondary international students at the college or undergraduate level must provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from a province or territory with their study permit application. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will return any application received that does not include a PAL, unless otherwise exempt. This attestation will serve as proof that the student has been accounted for under a provincial or territorial allocation within the national cap. Provinces and territories have been asked to have a plan in place for issuing PALs by March 31, 2024. The Government of Canada is working with the Government of Quebec to determine how the certificat d’acceptation du Québec pour études could serve as a PAL. International students whose applications were received by IRCC before 8:30 a.m. on January 22, 2024, as well as those who have already been approved for a study permit and intend to travel to Canada for an upcoming program, do not need to take further action as a result of the cap. Who needs a provincial attestation letter? most post-secondary study permit applicants most non-degree granting graduate programs (for example, certificate programs and graduate diplomas) anyone else not included in the exception list below Who doesn’t need a provincial attestation letter? primary and secondary school students master’s or doctoral degree students in-Canada visiting or exchange students studying at a designated learning institution Corrected on February 27, 2024 in-Canada study permit and work permit holders (includes study permit holders applying for an extension) in-Canada family members of study permit or work permit holders students whose application we received before 8:30 a.m. EST on January 22, 2024 2. Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) update for graduates of master’s degree programs In recognition that graduates of master’s degree granting programs are excellent candidates to succeed in Canada’s labour market and potentially transition to permanent residence, we have made a change to the length of the PGWP, so that they have the opportunity to meet the required Canadian work experience in order to apply for their permanent residence. Starting on February 15, 2024, a longer, 3-year post-graduation work permit will be available to those who are graduating from a master’s degree program that is less than 2 years and who meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. The length of PGWPs for programs other than master’s degrees will continue to align with the length of the study program, to a maximum of 3 years. Who is eligible for a longer post-graduation work permit (PGWP)? Graduates of programs that are at least two years in length at PGWP-eligible designated learning institutions are eligible for a 3-year PGWP, as are graduates of master’s degree programs less than 2 years in length. 3. PGWP eligibility for public-private partnership college programs Some provinces allow public colleges to license their curriculum to be delivered by an affiliated private college. In these cases, students physically attend a private college, but graduate with a diploma from a public institution. Concerns have been raised with regard to the quality of education provided by these institutions, as well as the lack of sufficient student supports. The Auditor General of Ontario has also raised concerns about a lack of oversight into program quality and student services at these institutions. As such, IRCC has made a change to restrict PGWPs for these institutions, anticipating that without the ability to apply for a PGWP, there will be a reduction in the number of international students enrolling in them. Who is eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? International students currently enrolled will remain eligible for a PGWP if they meet other program eligibility criteria. Who is not eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? New students enrolling in this type of program will not be eligible for a post-graduation work permit. 4. Changes to open work permit eligibility for spouses In the coming weeks, eligibility for open work permits for the spouses and common-law partners of international students will be updated. Who can get an open work permit? Eligibility is limited to the spouses and common-law partners of students in graduate (master’s and doctorate) and professional degree–granting programs only. Once these changes are in effect, spouses and common-law partners of international students seeking to extend their existing work permit will continue to be eligible under this stream. Who will not be eligible for an open work permit? The spouses and common-law partners of international students in other levels of study, including undergraduate and college programs, will no longer be eligible for an open work permit unless they already hold an open work permit under this stream.

Pending Cabinet’s approval, we’ll complete the final step to reach 500,000 in 2025 and in 2026, we’ll stabilize permanent resident levels. This will allow new permanent residents to better integrate into our communities. It will also continue to meet the needs of Canada’s labour market. We launched a new Francophone immigration policy that promotes the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities, as well as a series of measures that support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. We launched an online portal that lets some permanent residence applicants apply online finalize their permanent residence get their permanent resident card without in-person interaction We launched an online application status tracker that lets some family class permanent residence applicants, sponsors and their representatives more easily check their application status online (in the spouse, partner and dependent child categories). We reduced the backlog of Express Entry applications. New applicants can expect their applications to be processed within 6 months. We’ll continue to review and improve our processes so we can eliminate steps, use technology to support our employees and speed up processing.

It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders. The principal applicant must demonstrate they have the ability to become economically established. A Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) applicant may have a child who does not meet the definition of “dependent child” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), and therefore cannot be included in the application for permanent residence. If an economic development organization of a participating community decides to issue a recommendation to this dependant in their own right, this dependant will then have to submit their own application for permanent residence and will be assessed on the merits of their own ability to become economically established. Factors to examine when determining the ability to become economically established In cases where the officer is not satisfied that the issuance of a recommendation and the fulfilment of the selection criteria are sufficient indicators of an applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada, they may examine certain factors as part of the overall assessment to determine the applicant’s ability to become economically established. These factors may include current job or job offer language ability work experience education and training The weight given to these factors may vary on a case-by-case basis. For example, when an applicant has a high level of education such as a PhD and is nominated for a low-level service position, this mismatch may be acceptable if the job is an entry-level opportunity. If the same PhD applicant were nominated for a position as a welder and lacked the relevant training and work experience, there would be little alignment between their labour market intentions and their skills and abilities. An indicator of the ability to become economically established is the applicant’s intention and ability to enter the labour market in order to fully support themselves. If the officer is not satisfied that the individual intends to enter the labour market, they should consider refusing the application. Critical in determining the applicant’s ability to become economically established is the officer’s comparison of the requirements of the occupation (indicated by the National Occupation Classification (NOC) in the submitted recommendation) with all of the information provided by the applicant. The officer must examine all information provided to ensure that there is consistency throughout the elements of the application before making a final determination. The applicant should be invited to address any concerns that arise, in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness.

EMPP is Canada’s model for refugee and displaced person labour mobility, and it aims to address Canadian labour shortages while providing durable solutions for refugees and displaced persons with the skills and qualifications that Canadian employers need. EMPP applicants will arrive in Canada with permanent residence status as economic immigrants and will be eligible for the full suite of settlement and integration services that are offered to all economic immigrants, including pre-arrival orientation and referral to in-Canada settlement services and supports. They are not, however, entitled to refugee resettlement assistance, as they are economic immigrants. This means that it is very important for them to be able to demonstrate that they can establish themselves and provide for their own basic needs and those of their family during their first year in Canada.

As a result, some of these vulnerable people who never had status—or lost it—are now at risk of being deported to their country of birth. After living in Canada for years, many have little or no connection to their country of birth, and often do not speak the language. Canada is committed to addressing the situation and providing fair and equal access to Canada’s immigration system. That’s why Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada introduced a public policy to provide a permanent residence pathway for individuals who came to Canada as minors, were placed in protective care, and never obtained permanent residence or citizenship status as a result. This public policy is in force until January 21, 2027. This new permanent residence pathway builds on previous measures introduced in fall 2023. As of September 29, 2023, through the introduction of new ministerial instructions, eligible individuals previously in child protection services have been able to apply for a temporary resident permit (TRP) and a work or study permit. The TRP provides temporary resident status and reduces the risk of removal from Canada. Those who were eligible for the TRP will now be able to apply for permanent residence through this pathway.

Note: In these instructions “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Service Agency. The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with Employer-specific work permits with Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) exemptions Conditions and validity period on work permits Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant For more information on the permanent residence process for provincial nominees, see Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). In this situation, “province” legally refers to provinces and territories. Therefore, in these instructions, when “province” is used, it refers to both provinces and territories. A person may be issued a work permit without requiring an LMIA, if they have a valid nomination from a province (other than Quebec) for permanent residence and a job offer from an employer based in that province. Work permit applications that include a valid nomination from a province or territory are processed under paragraph 204(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations using the administrative LMIA exemption code T13. For Quebec cases, the legislative authority for the LMIA exemption is paragraph R205(a). For further information, see Quebec cases.

Officers should check the client notes to verify the nomination has not been “paused” by the province of issuance (for example, a job offer has been withdrawn or the province is conducting an investigation). Documentary evidence The application for the work permit must include the following: an LMIA-exempt offer of employment submitted in the Employer Portal (or through an alternate submission if it was approved) and proof the employer has paid the employer compliance fee a copy of the confirmation of nomination letter from the provincial government that verifies that the foreign national has been nominated for permanent residence by the province Officers should not request the nomination certificate as provincial nominees are not issued a copy a statement from the province that it has determined that all factors required for the issuance of a work permit under paragraph R204(c) as per its agreement with Canada have been met The required factors include that the nominated individual is urgently required by the provincial-based employer that the job offer is genuine and will create economic benefits or opportunities that the employment is not part-time or seasonal that the wages and working conditions of the employment would be sufficient to attract and retain Canadian citizens or permanent residents Note: “Urgently required” means there should be no unreasonable delay between approval and start of employment. Applications that do not include the requested information will be refused since they do not meet the eligibility requirements under R204(c); they would require a LMIA. If an officer is not satisfied that the applicant is able to perform the work stated in the job offer, the officer is prohibited from issuing a work permit under R200(3)(a). Expired nomination If the nomination is expired, the foreign national must include a copy of the acknowledgement of receipt letter with their work permit application confirming that IRCC has received the PNP permanent residence application before the nomination expired. Officers must verify that the PNP application is in the Global Case Management System (GCMS), or go through the Permanent Resident Digital Intake tool or the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) in Sydney if the permanent resident application is not in GCMS to ensure that the nomination has not been withdrawn by the province and that no adverse information is found regarding the file. Questions regarding nominations should be referred to the CIO in Sydney. Reminder: Officers should not request the nomination certificate from clients as provincial nominees are not issued a copy.

No other case type will allow the correct linkage in GCMS. Entering a case type other than 52 will result in incorrect accounting for GCMS, requiring manual corrections to be made and making inspection activities more difficult.

to become economically established in New Brunswick and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the Province. New Brunswick will codify and publish Provincial Nominee Program requirements, policy and procedures in publicly available directives. Applicants will be required to meet these criteria in order to be nominated. New Brunswick will respect the principles and objectives of this Annex in developing and implementing its criteria and procedures. 4.4 New Brunswick will provide Canada, in confidence, all necessary information regarding the criteria, policies and procedures that it has established for the categories under its Provincial Nominee Program, as outlined in stream design templates provided by Canada, prior to the introduction or modification of any Provincial Nominee Program stream, category or pilot project. Canada will conduct a review of any proposed changes and, if it has determined that the changes are consistent with the IRPA, the IRPR and national immigration policies, Canada and New Brunswick will agree to the proposed changes. To the extent possible, the timing and duration of the review will be mutually agreed upon by Canada and New Brunswick prior to the start of the review process, taking into account resource constraints. While Canada will strive to undertake the review as expeditiously as possible, the period of this review will vary according to the complexity of the proposed changes.

For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory (LMIA exemption code T13). To help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP.

under the Bridging open work permit guidance. The following special program code should be used: CARE4411 (Caregivers – HCCP Pilot) CARE4412 (Caregivers – HSW Pilot) Application assessment Work permit applications are processed based on the information provided by the foreign national. If the foreign national has indicated on their work permit application that they are applying for an open work permit, officers must ensure that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements, regardless of whether an employer’s name is mentioned in the application. If it is clear that complex or contentious issues or concerns exist on the APR (for example, the APR is approved in principle, but further investigation on the client is required), the work permit application should be referred to a local office for additional review. Once satisfied that any complex or contentious issues have been resolved, the local office can issue the work permit following these same instructions. Important: Officers should ensure that both general and specific eligibility are met. Permanent residence application stage Express Entry or QSWC: Completeness check If a foreign national submits an e-APR using Express Entry or submits an application under the QSWC, they may apply for an open work permit using this administrative LMIA exemption code once they meet the General eligibility criteria. A BOWP can only be issued if the e-APR or QSWC application has passed the section R10 completeness check. As such, Express Entry applicants or QSWC applicants should submit their acknowledgement of receipt with their BOWP application. Before issuing a BOWP, officers must check the GCMS to ensure that the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) has reviewed the application and determined that it meets the requirements of a complete application as described in sections R10 and R12.01.

system","1":"0","2":"Updated temporary public policy to grant permanent residence to certain individuals in Canada who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were under the legal responsibility of the child protection system Background Individuals who apply for permanent residence in Canada are generally unable to obtain permanent resident status if they are inadmissible to Canada. This creates a challenge for those who came to Canada as a minor but did not obtain permanent residence or citizenship and are now ineligible, including those who later committed crimes in Canada. Not all individuals who came to Canada as a minor obtained permanent residence or citizenship. Others have since lost their permanent resident status due to being inadmissible. Some of these individuals were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider under a provincial or territorial government’s designated ministry for child protection by court order as a minor in Canada. In some cases, permanent resident status or citizenship were not sought for these individuals when they were eligible and while under the legal responsibility of a child protection agency and, as a result, some individuals who are now inadmissible are facing deportation and an uncertain future. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the vulnerability of these individuals, and the particular risk they may face if deported to their country of nationality; a country with which they have little or no connection and of which they, often, do not speak the language as a result of living in Canada for many years. Public Policy Considerations In recognition of the vulnerability of certain individuals who came to Canada under the age of 19 and were placed under the legal responsibility of a child and family services provider, and may now face removal, this public policy will provide a pathway to permanent residence to eligible foreign nationals and their in-Canada family members.

Canada’s immigration targets to support sustainable growth","1":"2","2":" a more collaborative approach to levels planning with our partners. Canada will continue to welcome newcomers and ensure that they are supported in their new lives.” – The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Quick facts The Levels Plan is a projection of how many permanent residents will be admitted to Canada in a given year and sets targets for overall admissions per immigration category. Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Minister must table the Levels Plan in Parliament each year. The Levels Plan identifies permanent resident targets in four categories: economic immigration, family reunification, refugees and protected persons, and the humanitarian and compassionate class. IRCC is supporting employers through measures like category-based selection. As part of this initiative, IRCC is increasing the number of invitations to individuals with work experience in health care, STEM, transport, agriculture and agri-food, trades and French proficiency. On August 3, 2023, 1,500 invitations were sent to individuals with experience in the skilled trades (including carpenters, contractors, plumbers, etc.). Over the last five years, close to 38,000 tradespersons have obtained permanent residency in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class, the Provincial Nominee Program, and the Federal Skilled Trades program. Bringing in immigrants to fill labour market gaps will help Canada deliver on its National Housing Strategy, an ambitious 10-year plan that will invest more than $82 billion to give more Canadians a place to call home. Progress on programs and initiatives under this strategy is updated quarterly at www.placetocallhome.ca. Canada continues to be a global leader in refugee resettlement and labour mobility.

communities and meet labour needs across the country. January 16, 2024, Caraquet, New Brunswick—Francophone immigration plays a crucial role in Canada’s economic growth and promotes the vitality of Francophone minority communities and meet labour needs across the country. Today, the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced in Caraquet, New Brunswick, a series of initiatives to support Francophone immigration outside Quebec. These measures include a new Francophone immigration policy, the renewal and expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities initiative, a new program to support Francophone immigration, and the implementation of the Action Plan for Official Languages—and they will all strengthen the presence of French in Canada. Francophone immigration policy The new policy promotes the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities. It paves the way for tangible, ambitious and innovative actions in the short, medium and long term that will enable progress towards restoring and increasing the demographic weight of these communities. It is also based on a series of measures such as promotion and recruitment support efforts, both in Canada and abroad, particularly for specific lines of business, in order to address labour shortages. The policy will also oversee the development of a new program and new measures dedicated to Francophone economic immigration.

Francophone Immigration Support Program The new Francophone Immigration Support Program will fund innovative projects to eliminate barriers to Francophone immigration. This will make it easier for Francophone minority communities to participate in international promotion initiatives and support and recruit French-speaking candidates. The Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028 These initiatives are supported by an investment of over $137 million announced as part of the Government of Canada’s Action Plan for Official Languages 2023-2028. The implementation of all the measures in the action plan demonstrates the federal government’s firm commitment to the vitality of Francophone minority communities. The Minister also highlighted that the target of 4.4.% French-speaking resident admissions outside Quebec was surpassed in December 2023, reaching approximately 4.7% from January to December 2023, according to the currently available statistical data. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will be able to confirm the complete 2023 statistics by February 2024. Last November, IRCC announced ambitious, realistic and achievable targets for the next three years. The targets for Francophone immigrant admissions outside Quebec are 6% in 2024, 7% in 2025 and 8% in 2026. These measures will facilitate the strengthening, long-term growth and vitality of Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories, as well as key stakeholders, to strengthen these communities.

With the modernized Official Languages Act and the Action Plan 2023–2028, which has been in effect since this autumn, our government is implementing the necessary mechanisms and investments to achieve targets that are both ambitious and essential.” - The Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages Quick facts In April 2023, the Government of Canada announced the Action Plan for Official Languages 2023–2028: Protection-Promotion-Collaboration. The Government is committed to implementing the measures proposed in Pillar 1: Francophone Immigration: Towards the Re-establishment of the Demographic Weight of Francophones. Under the modernized Official Languages Act, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship is obligated to adopt a policy on Francophone immigration that includes objectives, targets, and indicators. In 2023, more than 19,600 French-speaking immigrants settled in Francophone communities outside Quebec. In November 2023, the Government of Canada announced nearly $85,000 in financial assistance for the Université de l’Ontario français. This investment supports the implementation of the Observatoire en immigration Francophone au Canada and contributes to Canada’s efforts to promote the reception and integration of Francophone immigrants.

information about International Student Program reforms","1":"0","2":"Additional information about International Student Program reforms Ottawa, February 5, 2024—Further information is being provided to clarify the announcement of an intake cap on new international study permit applications and other changes. International students make important contributions to Canada’s campuses, communities and economy; however, we have seen unsustainable growth in the International Student Program in recent years. These recently announced reforms will support sustainable population growth in Canada and improve system integrity, while helping to ensure that international students have a positive experience in Canada. 1. Cap and provincial attestation letter As of 8:30 a.m. ET on January 22, 2024, most new post-secondary international students at the college or undergraduate level must provide a provincial attestation letter (PAL) from a province or territory with their study permit application. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will return any application received that does not include a PAL, unless otherwise exempt. This attestation will serve as proof that the student has been accounted for under a provincial or territorial allocation within the national cap. Provinces and territories have been asked to have a plan in place for issuing PALs by March 31, 2024. The Government of Canada is working with the Government of Quebec to determine how the certificat d’acceptation du Québec pour études could serve as a PAL. International students whose applications were received by IRCC before 8:30 a.m. on January 22, 2024, as well as those who have already been approved for a study permit and intend to travel to Canada for an upcoming program, do not need to take further action as a result of the cap.

Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) update for graduates of master’s degree programs In recognition that graduates of master’s degree granting programs are excellent candidates to succeed in Canada’s labour market and potentially transition to permanent residence, we have made a change to the length of the PGWP, so that they have the opportunity to meet the required Canadian work experience in order to apply for their permanent residence. Starting on February 15, 2024, a longer, 3-year post-graduation work permit will be available to those who are graduating from a master’s degree program that is less than 2 years and who meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. The length of PGWPs for programs other than master’s degrees will continue to align with the length of the study program, to a maximum of 3 years. Who is eligible for a longer post-graduation work permit (PGWP)? Graduates of programs that are at least two years in length at PGWP-eligible designated learning institutions are eligible for a 3-year PGWP, as are graduates of master’s degree programs less than 2 years in length. 3. PGWP eligibility for public-private partnership college programs Some provinces allow public colleges to license their curriculum to be delivered by an affiliated private college.

The Auditor General of Ontario has also raised concerns about a lack of oversight into program quality and student services at these institutions. As such, IRCC has made a change to restrict PGWPs for these institutions, anticipating that without the ability to apply for a PGWP, there will be a reduction in the number of international students enrolling in them. Who is eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? International students currently enrolled will remain eligible for a PGWP if they meet other program eligibility criteria. Who is not eligible for a PGWP after graduating from a public-private partnership college program? New students enrolling in this type of program will not be eligible for a post-graduation work permit. 4. Changes to open work permit eligibility for spouses In the coming weeks, eligibility for open work permits for the spouses and common-law partners of international students will be updated. Who can get an open work permit? Eligibility is limited to the spouses and common-law partners of students in graduate (master’s and doctorate) and professional degree–granting programs only. Once these changes are in effect, spouses and common-law partners of international students seeking to extend their existing work permit will continue to be eligible under this stream. Who will not be eligible for an open work permit?

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders. The principal applicant must demonstrate they have the ability to become economically established. A Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) applicant may have a child who does not meet the definition of “dependent child” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), and therefore cannot be included in the application for permanent residence. If an economic development organization of a participating community decides to issue a recommendation to this dependant in their own right, this dependant will then have to submit their own application for permanent residence and will be assessed on the merits of their own ability to become economically established. Factors to examine when determining the ability to become economically established In cases where the officer is not satisfied that the issuance of a recommendation and the fulfilment of the selection criteria are sufficient indicators of an applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada, they may examine certain factors as part of the overall assessment to determine the applicant’s ability to become economically established. These factors may include current job or job offer language ability work experience education and training The weight given to these factors may vary on a case-by-case basis. For example, when an applicant has a high level of education such as a PhD and is nominated for a low-level service position, this mismatch may be acceptable if the job is an entry-level opportunity. If the same PhD applicant were nominated for a position as a welder and lacked the relevant training and work experience, there would be little alignment between their labour market intentions and their skills and abilities.

Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP)","1":"0","2":"Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP) This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders. EMPP is Canada’s model for refugee and displaced person labour mobility, and it aims to address Canadian labour shortages while providing durable solutions for refugees and displaced persons with the skills and qualifications that Canadian employers need. EMPP applicants will arrive in Canada with permanent residence status as economic immigrants and will be eligible for the full suite of settlement and integration services that are offered to all economic immigrants, including pre-arrival orientation and referral to in-Canada settlement services and supports. They are not, however, entitled to refugee resettlement assistance, as they are economic immigrants. This means that it is very important for them to be able to demonstrate that they can establish themselves and provide for their own basic needs and those of their family during their first year in Canada. Regional EMPP (formerly known simply as EMPP prior to the creation of Federal EMPP) allows applicants to apply through: Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) Note: Regional EMPP applications do not count toward other program level allocations for AIP, PNP or RNIP. Regional EMPP candidates differ from candidates applying directly to AIP, PNP or RNIP as they must meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the Public Policy to support the Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP) – Phase 2. Applicants also have access to EMPP-specific services. Federal EMPP is a pathway that allows applicants to apply through a dedicated Federal EMPP stream: A. Job offer steam B.

permanent residence pathway for former minors in protective care","1":"0","2":"Ottawa, January 23, 2024—A small number of individuals who came to Canada as minors never obtained permanent residence or citizenship while they were in the custody of child protection services. As a result, some of these vulnerable people who never had status—or lost it—are now at risk of being deported to their country of birth. After living in Canada for years, many have little or no connection to their country of birth, and often do not speak the language. Canada is committed to addressing the situation and providing fair and equal access to Canada’s immigration system. That’s why Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada introduced a public policy to provide a permanent residence pathway for individuals who came to Canada as minors, were placed in protective care, and never obtained permanent residence or citizenship status as a result. This public policy is in force until January 21, 2027. This new permanent residence pathway builds on previous measures introduced in fall 2023. As of September 29, 2023, through the introduction of new ministerial instructions, eligible individuals previously in child protection services have been able to apply for a temporary resident permit (TRP) and a work or study permit. The TRP provides temporary resident status and reduces the risk of removal from Canada. Those who were eligible for the TRP will now be able to apply for permanent residence through this pathway.

Due to Iran’s crackdown on protestors following the killing of Mahsa Amini, the Government of Canada introduced special measures to support Iranian temporary residents in Canada as well as Canadian citizens and permanent residents living in Iran. These special measures are now being extended until February 28, 2025. Under these special measures, Iranian nationals in Canada with valid temporary resident status can continue to study, work or visit family by applying for an extension of their status free of charge. They can also apply to move between temporary streams, from within Canada, at no cost. Additionally, Canadian citizens and Canadian permanent residents in Iran who wish to leave can continue to apply for passports and permanent resident travel documents for free.

In this situation, “province” legally refers to provinces and territories. Therefore, in these instructions, when “province” is used, it refers to both provinces and territories. A person may be issued a work permit without requiring an LMIA, if they have a valid nomination from a province (other than Quebec) for permanent residence and a job offer from an employer based in that province. Work permit applications that include a valid nomination from a province or territory are processed under paragraph 204(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations using the administrative LMIA exemption code T13. For Quebec cases, the legislative authority for the LMIA exemption is paragraph R205(a). For further information, see Quebec cases.

Expired nomination If the nomination is expired, the foreign national must include a copy of the acknowledgement of receipt letter with their work permit application confirming that IRCC has received the PNP permanent residence application before the nomination expired. Officers must verify that the PNP application is in the Global Case Management System (GCMS), or go through the Permanent Resident Digital Intake tool or the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) in Sydney if the permanent resident application is not in GCMS to ensure that the nomination has not been withdrawn by the province and that no adverse information is found regarding the file. Questions regarding nominations should be referred to the CIO in Sydney. Reminder: Officers should not request the nomination certificate from clients as provincial nominees are not issued a copy. Work permit issuance in GCMS Under the Application screen enter the following: Field Selection or input Case type 52– Employer-specific LMIA-exempt applications The Case type field must indicate “52”. No other case type will allow the correct linkage in GCMS.
